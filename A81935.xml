         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>They likewiſe the more to enſure their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to carry it on with the more plauſibility, publiſh an Act of State for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Writs in <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> as that in ſtead of King, the Name, Stile and Teſt, <hi>&amp; Cuſtodis Libertatis Angliae Authoritate Parliamenti</hi> be uſed, and none other, and all Writs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould run ſo, of which all concerned in the Law were required to take notice.

               <p>The Houſes likewiſe take upon them a more then Papall power, and becauſe he Prieſt could indeed abſolve them, they are reſolved to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve themſelves and all thoſe engaged with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170564:11"/>them, by an Act repealing the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and Supremacy.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Lords Houſe perceiving that by reaſon of his Majeſties death, the Judges gave not that aſſiſtance to them which was uſuall, by reaſon his death had extinguiſhed their power as Judges, deſired that eighteen of the Commons might be ſent to conferre with nine of the Lords, but it would not be aſſented to.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Commons having executed their King, the Nobles are an eyeſore to them, they therefore reſolve to take away as many of them as they can bring within their reach; they reſolve to begin with thoſe they have already in hold; and the Commiſſion of the High-Court of Juſtice for his Majeſties Triall being expired, they create a new one conſiſting of ſixty three perſons, of which any fifteen had power to act; for the triall of Duke <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> as Earl of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Lord <hi>Capell</hi> (who attempted an

               </p>
               <p>And now they take into conſideration the reception of their numerous fellow members which by the arbitrary force of the Army had been excluded, and at laſt they vote, <hi>That none ſhould be admitted into the Houſe who had voted that his late Majeſties Conceſſions were a ground for Peace, and for the firm ſettlement of theſe Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament having cut off one of thoſe three Eſtates by which the Nation had ſo long been governed, think likewiſe of aboliſhing the ſecond, that they alone might have the whole power; therefore upon conſiderations of the Houſe of Lords, in what capacity they ſhould ſtand; they vote, 1. <hi>That they would make no farther addreſſes to them.</hi> 2. <hi>That they would receive none from them.</hi> 3. <hi>That an Act be drawn to aboliſh that Houſe as dangerous and uſeleſs.</hi> Thus is the whole baſis of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which had continued in <hi>England</hi> ſo many hundred years, overthrown in ten dayes, and the two ancient grand Eſtates of the Land cut off.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:170564:12"/>
               <p>Having aboliſhed one Government, they proceed to conſider of the eſtabliſhment of another, but agree only in a negative Vote, <hi>That there ſhould for the future be no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in</hi> England <hi>either by King or Houſe of Lords.</hi> They break the old Great Seal, and cauſe a new one to be made, which is delivered to the keeping of three Commiſſioners, <hi>viz.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>Liſle.</hi> They likewiſe conſider of Oaths to be adminiſtred to the Judges, who thereupon meet, and upon debate ſix of them are content to continue in their employments, provided the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Laws of the Land be not altered, which were, <hi>viz.</hi> Chief Juſtice <hi>Rolles,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of the Kings Bench, Lord Chief Juſtice S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> Juſtice <hi>Pheſant</hi> of the Common Pleas, Lord Chief Baron <hi>Wild,</hi> and Baron <hi>Yates:</hi> and in order to theſe Judges ſatisfaction in their forementioned ſcruple, the Parliament by their Declaration of the ninth of <hi>February</hi> do declare, <hi>That they are fully reſolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſhall and will uphold, preſerve and keep the fundamentall Laws of this Nation, for and concerning the preſervation of the lives, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and liberties of the people, with all things incident there unto; with the alterations touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King and Houſe of Lords already reſolved in this preſent Parliament for the good of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170564:13"/>people, and whatſoever ſhall be further neceſſary to the perfecting thereof,</hi> and by it requiring all Judges, Juſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to execute and adminiſter in their reſpective Offices and Truſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Houſe order a Committee to conſider of ſuch Perſons as they ſhould think fit to be Juſtices of the Peace throughout the Nation: they likewiſe order another Committee, to conſider of Perſons whom they might judg fit to conſtitute a Councell of State, whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould be forty, whereof only five Lords, or not above. And whereas before they had only <hi>repealed,</hi> they now wholly <hi>make void</hi> the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus though the Parliament are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all means to make themſelves as ſecure and firm in the Government as they can, yet are the people generally diſcontented; thoſe who formerly affected them (now ſenſible of the inconveniencies like to enſue the cutting off of their Prince) as much diſaffect them, ſo that there is generally plotting in all Countries, which makes the Parliament ſend forces into ſeverall Counties to keep them in awe, whileſt the Royaliſts in <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle ſtill hold out, hoping ſome relief may ariſe from thoſe ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall diſcontents.</p>
               <p>But let us from <hi>England</hi> paſs a little into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and we ſhall find that the Kings
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170564:13"/>death is much more reſented there: at the firſt news of his <hi>Condemnation,</hi> they proclaim a ſolemn Faſt, with Prayers to God for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; but upon the news of his <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſuch was their ſorrow, that the whole City of <hi>Edenborough</hi> ſeemd a flood of tears. The Parliament upon this exigence are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, and putting it to the vote, it paſſed <hi>(nemine contradicente)</hi> that his <hi>Eldeſt Sonne</hi> ſhould be proclaimed <hi>King,</hi> and accordingly a Proclamation was drawn, which becauſe of ſome niceties in it, not uſuall in things of this nature, I think fit to inſert as followeth; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Eſtates of Parliament preſently convened in this ſecond Seſſion of the ſecond trienniall Parliament, by vertue of an Act of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Eſtates, who had power and authority from the laſt Parliament for convening the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, conſidering that foraſmuch as the Kings Majeſty who lately reigned, is contrary to the diſſent and proteſtation of this Kingdom, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a violent death; and that by the Lords bleſſing there is left unto us a righteous Heir and lawfull Succeſſor</hi> Charles <hi>Prince of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Wales, <hi>now King of</hi> Great Brittain, France <hi>and</hi> Ireland; <hi>We the Eſtates of the Parliament of the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>do therefore moſt unanimouſly and cheerfully, in recognition and

And becauſe his Majeſty is bound by the Law of God and fundamentall Laws of this Kingdom, to rule in righteouſneſs and equity, to the honour of God the good of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the wealth of his people; it is hereby declared, That before he be admitted to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his Royall power, he ſhall give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to this Kingdom in thoſe things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſecurity of Religion, the unity betwixt the Kingdoms, and the good and peace of this Kingdom, according to the Nationall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nont and the ſolemn League and Covenant; for which end we are reſolved with all poſſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to make our humble and earneſt addreſſes to his Majeſty: For the teſtification of all which, we the Parliament of the Kingdom of</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:170564:14"/>Scotland, <hi>publiſh this our acknowledgment of his juſt right, Title and ſucceſſion to the Crown of theſe Kingdoms, at the Market-Croſs in</hi> Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, <hi>with all uſuall ſolemnities in like caſes, and ordain his Royall Name, Portract and Seal to be uſed in the publike writings and Judicatories of this Kingdome, and in the Mint-houſe, as was uſually done to his Royall Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and command this Act to be proclaimed at all the Market-Croſſes of the Royall Burghs within this Kingdom, and to be printed, that none may pretend ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God ſave King</hi> Charles <hi>the ſecond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was done by the Parliament, the Lords in all their Robes; the Croſs was richly hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Chancellor brought up the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, read it to the King at Arms who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it; there being an univerſall joy in the City; and their great Guns from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſending peals of the ſame into the adjacent Countries. The ſolemnity being paſt, care was taken for the ſending Meſſengers to acquaint his <hi>Majeſty</hi> with the buſineſs; S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edward Douglas</hi> was choſen to go and acquaint him with it, to deſire him to take heed of evill Councellors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there ſhould very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily a more full addreſs be made to him. In the mean time a Faſt is proclaimed, and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170564:15"/>made, that God would proſper their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him for the good both of the Kirk and State. The Lords and the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the mean time put on mourning for the death of his Father.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>England</hi> again: The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed old King <hi>Charles</hi> was <hi>February</hi> 12. thirteen days after his death buried at <hi>Windſor</hi> (in the ſame Vault where <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth was interred (without any manner of ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Juxon</hi> and ſome few others attending him to his Funerall.</p>
               <p>The Parliament not thinking that they are not yet ſecure enough, whileſt they have only power over mens bodies, endeavour the like over their ſouls. They therefore Enact, that every Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> at the time of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their Freedome, ſhould take the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Oath, <hi>viz. You ſhall ſwear, That you ſhall be true and faithfull to the Commonwealth of</hi> England, <hi>and in order there unto, you ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the juſt Government of the City of</hi> London: <hi>You ſhall to your beſt power maintain the peace, and all the due Franchiſes thereof, and to your knowledge and ability do and perform all Acts and things belonging to a Free-man of the ſaid City.</hi> They likewiſe Enact, that the ſaid Oath, <hi>Mutatis mutandis,</hi> be taken by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Free-man in every City, Borrough, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170564:15"/>Town Corporate, in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> at the time of their admiſſion to Freedome, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>The Extraordinary Ambaſſadors for the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> (having had audience and promiſe of Redreſs for the injuries done to their Ships, provided the wrong-doers could be found out) being on departure, many thanks and civilities having paſt between them and the Houſe; they Order two Members to give them a ſolemn farewell, who accompanied them to <hi>Graveſend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Army again Petition the Parliament, in proſecution of ſome deſires formerly preſented to them, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>To make and eſtabliſh ſuch wholeſome Laws (in the native Language) as may preſerve the Intereſt and Liberties of this Commonwealth.</hi> 2. <hi>That Tithes may be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</hi> 3. <hi>That no puniſhment be inflicted upon any man for the Exerciſe of his Conſcience.</hi> 4. <hi>That all that had to deal in the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury be called to account; and that free Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be taken off.</hi> 5. <hi>That all Perſons whatſoever may have a free and equall Adminiſtration of the Law.</hi> 6. <hi>That Perſons impriſoned for Debt, having nothing to pay, may be releaſed; and that ſuch as are able and ſhelter themſelves in priſon, be forced to pay.</hi> 7. <hi>That all Perſons in priſon for pretended words,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be brought to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170564:16"/>triall, and if found innocent, have ſatisfaction for falſe impriſonment.</hi> 8. <hi>That Proviſion might be made for the Poor of the Nation.</hi> 9. <hi>That conſtant Pay may be provided to prevent free Quarter.</hi> 10. <hi>That the Arrears of the Army might be paid out of the Kings, Deans, and Chapters Lands.</hi> 11. <hi>That their want of Horſes might be ſupplied.</hi> 12. <hi>That care might be taken for prevention of clipt Money.</hi> 13. <hi>That the Articles of Warre might be miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</hi> 14. <hi>That the Souldiers might not be put to the execution of civil Orders, as ſeizing on unlicenſed Books, diſtraining of Moneys, or the like, ſo that the people may not complain of their intrenchment on their Liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were <hi>February</hi> 19. 1649. drawn up by the Army, as their humble Petition and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Parliament; but we need not think it ſtrange that every common Souldier ſhould have liberty to propoſe what was neceſſary to be done in the Government, ſince they had perfectly the whole power in their hands, and had firſt by the fetches of ſome of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, excluded and extirpated all other power, to give life and being to this ſhadow of a Government, this little finger of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet ten times heavier to the Nation, then the whole loynes of its legal Magiſtracy. But to return to our purpoſe, the Parliament
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170564:16"/>(for ſo in their own language we muſt call them) order the Triall of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> (who though he was no Engliſhman, yet was arraigned under the Name of Earl of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> thereby to ſubject him to the Engliſh Law) together with the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Lord <hi>Capell,</hi> Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Owen,</hi> the two firſt of which were afterwards beheaded in Pallace-yard, and the two laſt meeting with more favour from them, were ſuffered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part beyond Seas.</p>
               <p>A Councell of State being ſetled by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they met at <hi>Derby</hi> Houſe, where ſome Propoſitions of the Parliaments in order to their unanimous Proceedings, were tendred to them, <hi>viz.</hi> the approbation of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the late King, the Houſe of Lords, the preſent Alteration and ſome other. Theſe were by them received, with ſome diſlike to ſome of the particulars, and their diſlike being mentioned in the Houſe, was referred to a Committee.</p>
               <p>The Prince Elector Palatine makes his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the Parliament, with returnes of thanks for their former favours, and deſires that 5600<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> due of his laſt years Penſion might be paid; that the Penſion of 8000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
                  <hi>per annum</hi> might be continued; and that he might have the Paſs of the Houſe for himſelf, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170564:17"/>and forty Horſe to go home. The firſt and laſt deſires were granted, and the Summe due Ordered to be paid him; but the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of his Penſion put off to further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>The Parliament and Councell of State agree upon an Atteſtation, to be taken by every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall Member of the Councell of State, which ran as followeth, <hi>viz. I</hi> A. B. <hi>being of the Councell of State, do Teſtifie that I do adhere unto this preſent Parliament, in the maintenance and defence of the publick Liberty and Freedome of this Nation, as it is now De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and to the Government for future in way of a Republick without</hi> King, <hi>or</hi> Houſe of Peers: <hi>And I do promiſe in the ſight of God, that through his grace I will be faithfull in the performance of the truſt committed to me as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and therein faithfully purſue the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions given to this Councell by this preſent Parliament, and not reveal or diſcloſe any thing in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, that ſhall be debated or reſolved on in Counſell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out command or direction in Parliament, or the Order and allowance of the major part of them, that ſhall be preſent at ſuch debates or reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In confirmation of the Premiſſes I have hereunto ſet my hand.</hi> To which Atteſtation, the Clerk of the Parliament is Ordered to ſee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170564:17"/>that every individuall Member of the Councell of State do Subſcribe. And now comes out the Proteſtation of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt the Proceedings touching his Majeſties Life and Perſon, which becauſe it was of ſo eminent concernment, I ſhall here inſert the moſt materiall Circumſtances, <hi>viz. That by their Letter of the ſixth inſtant</hi> (viz. <hi>January</hi>) <hi>they repreſented unto you what endeavours have been uſed, for taking away of his Majeſties life, for Change of the fundamentall Government of this Kingdome, and introducing a ſinfull and ungodly Toleration in matters of Religion; and therein they did expreſs their ſad thoughts and great feares, of the dangerous conſequences that might follow thereupon; and further they did earneſtly preſs, that there might be no proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt his Majeſties Perſon, which would certainly continue the great diſtractions of the Kingdomes, and involve them in many evils, troubles, and confuſions; but that by the free Councels of both Houſes of the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>and with the advice and conſent of the Parliament of</hi> Scotland, <hi>ſuch courſe might be taken in relation to him, as may be for the good and happineſs of theſe Kingdomes, both having an unqueſtionable intereſt in his Perſon, as King of both, which duely conſidered, we had reaſon to hope ſhould have given a ſtop to all Proceedings
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170564:18"/>againſt his Majesties Perſon. But they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that after many of the Members of the Houſe of Commons have been impriſoned and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. and alſo without and againſt the Conſent of the Houſe of Peers, by a ſingle Act of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament alone, power being given to certain Perſons of their own Number of the Army, and ſome others, to proceed againſt his Majesties Perſon; in order whereunto he was brought upon Saturday laſt in the afternoon, before this new Extraordinary Court. Wherefore they do in the Name of the Parliament of</hi> Scotland, <hi>for their vindication from falſe aſperſions and calumnies declare; That though they are not ſatisfied with his Majeſties Conceſſions at</hi> New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>in the Iſle of</hi> Wight, <hi>eſpecially in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and are reſolved not to crave his Majestes reſtitution to this Government, before ſatisfaction be given by him to this</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <hi>yet they do all unanimouſly with one voice (not one Member excepted) diſclaim the leaſt knowledge of, or acceſſion to the late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Army againſt his Majeſty; and ſincerely profeſs, that it will be a great grief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, and lie heavy upon their ſpirits, if they ſhall ſee the trusting of his Majeſties Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Honourable Houſes of the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>to be made uſe of to his ruine, ſo far contrary to the declared intentions of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170564:18"/>Kingdome of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and ſolemn profeſſions of the Kingdome of</hi> England; <hi>and to the end it may be manifeſt to the world, how much they abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and deteſt ſo horrid a deſign againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Perſon, they do in the Name of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Kingdome of</hi> Scotland, <hi>Declare their diſſent from the ſaid Proceedings, and the taking away of his Majeſties Life; and proteſt that as they are altogether free from the ſame, ſo they may be free from all the evils, miſeries, confuſions, and calamities, that may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon to theſe diſtracted King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In thus much is contracted the large Letter of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Parliament, to which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in ſhort anſwer; <hi>That as to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the fundamentall Laws of the Land, and allowing liberty of Conſcience in Religion, if</hi> Scotland <hi>had not the ſame power of liberty; as they did not go about to confine them, ſo they would not be limited to them; but (leaving them to act in relation to theirs, as they ſhall ſee cauſe) reſolve to maintain their own Liberties, as God ſhould enable them. In relation to the putting the King to death, they had done it upon ſerious conſideration of the miſeries both they and the Nation had ſuffered, by the Miſgovernment and Tyranny of that man of ſin (as they term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him) that they doubted not but God would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170564:19"/>prosper them in it. That if</hi> Scotland <hi>would not now with them aſſert its Liberties, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe that quarrell, they would reap no other advantage by it, but a laſting Warre (and the miſeries that attend it) or the intailing of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſlavery under a Tyrant and his Iſſue, to them and their poſterity.</hi> Theſe jarrings at length produced a bloudy Warre betwixt the two Nations, to the devaſtation and almoſt utter ruine of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the ſequell of the Story will ſhow. The Parliament Order the Army to march Northward. The Parliament now more fully ordered that no Member whatſoever, who had abſented himſelf from ſitting in the Houſe ſince the 31. of <hi>December,</hi> 1648. ſhould be re-admitted into the Houſe, but ſhould be utterly ſecluded and barred from ſitting; except ſuch as had been imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſervice of the Parliament. They then conſider of wayes for raiſing of Money to ſerve their Occaſions; and in order thereto, appoint a Committee to conſider of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the late King, Queen, Prince, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how they may be improved to their greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>Collonel <hi>Popham,</hi> Collonel <hi>Dean,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Blake,</hi> who are to go with the Fleet, are ordered to go down immediately, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170564:19"/>nine pound a day appointed for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: The Lord <hi>Warwicks</hi> Commiſſion of Admirall of the Seas, and Warden of the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Ports being null'd, and that power put into the Hands of the Councell of State, who have devolved it upon thoſe three afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
               <p>In the mean time thoſe who ſtand out in the two Cityes of <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>London-Derry</hi> for this Parliament, earneſtly entreat relief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Ormond, Inchiqueen,</hi> and <hi>Owen-Roe,</hi> who were very near Compoſitions, ſhould joyn, which would go near to ruine all. They therefore deſire, that eight thouſand men formerly promiſed them, might come over, which would either hinder the malevolous Conjunction threatned, or be a good Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado againſt them; however they promiſe to hold out as long as poſſibly they can.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Lothian,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Cheſley,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Glendonning,</hi> who came as Commiſſioners from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to this of <hi>England,</hi> not having received any ſatisfaction in relation to their Inſtructions, or the Deſires of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what angry, but loath to expreſs their Choller by word of mouth, after their departure from <hi>London,</hi> ſend back a Letter by a ſervant to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170564:20"/>Parliament, (in the Name of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi>) enumerating all their Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the breach of all their Covenants, Oaths, and Proteſtations, for contiruance of the late Government, and how much they had gone contrary to all of them, in what they had now done to King, Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deſiring them to do their firſt work, which if they did not as they, that then they would waſh their hands of all the miſery, that was like to enſue. This ſo netled our Parliament, that they immediately impriſon the Meſſenger; and beſides the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſecret Order for the ſecuring the Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they put forth a Declaration againſt the Paper, arguing it to contain much ſcandalous and reproachfull matter, againſt the juſt Laws and Government of this Nation, to the high diſhonour thereof: That it was a deſign in the contrivers and ſubſcribers of it to raiſe Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and lay the grounds of a new and bloudy Warre. <hi>They therefore Declare, that all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever reſiding in</hi> England, <hi>or</hi> Ireland, <hi>or</hi> Scotland, <hi>that ſhall adhere to the ſaid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, in purſuance of the Grounds by them laid in the ſaid Paper, are Rebels and Traitors to the Commonwealth of</hi> England, <hi>and ſhall be proceeded againſt as Rebels and Traitors.</hi> They likewiſe Order that a Letter be ſent with a Copy of that Paper to the Parliament of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170564:20"/>
                  <hi>Scotland,</hi> to know if they will own or juſtifie it.</p>
               <p>The Parliament are ſo neceſſitated for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, that they are reſolved to let no way ſlip for the raiſing of it, the ancient Standard in the Palace-yard ſhall not ſcape, but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee is ordered to examine what it might be worth, in caſe it were ſold for publique uſe.</p>
               <p>The Parliament in conſideration of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Aſcues</hi> eminent ſervices at Sea, order him to be Admirall of the Iriſh Seas, and Modell the Expences of the Navy as low as they can poſſibly, whereby a great part of that vaſt Charge is ſaved; yet neither Cuſtome, Exciſe, nor Taxes made lower, but rather encreaſed, the Souldiers Petitioning for a larger Taxe, that free Quarter (the greater oppreſſion indeed of the two) might be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Severall Troopers who pretended a Liberty to Petition without the conſent of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, are puniſhed; five of them are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned firſt to ride with their Faces to the Horſe Tail, then to have their Swords broke over their Heads, and laſtly to be caſhiered; a Letter which they had concerning the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Liberty, being judged pernicious and ſcandalous to the Parliament and Counſell of State.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:170564:21"/>
               <p>About this time began thoſe great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances both in Army and Parliament, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the diſtaſt given to Lieutenant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> by the Parliaments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ſome deſires of his: But becauſe the Diſcourſe of it would now be too tedious, we ſhall let it alone till we come to treat of its Effects.</p>
               <p>But let us return now a little to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Parliament upon rumours that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army were marching towards them, prepare to reſiſt, and Vote the raiſing for their preſent defence 2000 Horſe and 6000 Foot, whileſt the Lord <hi>Seaforth</hi> and Collonel <hi>Heiſell</hi> are buſied in fortifying <hi>Enderneſs,</hi> and other ſtrong places in the North, all being reſolved to defend and maintain the Cauſe of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second with their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, many <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> flocking to them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> makes great Havock of the Merchants Ships and Goods in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Seas, which makes the Parliament haſten out their Fleet under the Command of <hi>Popham, Dean,</hi> and <hi>Blake,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And now on the ninth of <hi>March,</hi> 1648. thoſe three Lords, Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> (as Earl of <hi>Cambridge</hi>) the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and Lord
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170564:21"/>
                  <hi>Capell,</hi> were beheaded in the new Palace-yard <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for having raiſed Arms againſt the Parliament; nor could Duke <hi>Hamiltons</hi> pretending himſelf a ſtranger, and not ſubject to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> nor the Lord <hi>Capells</hi> claiming the Lord Generals promiſe of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, finde them voices enough to ſave their lives, (though the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Owen</hi> eſcaped by Superiority of voices.) They all three died reſolutely and handſomely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting men of ſo noble deſcents.</p>
               <p>The Parliament in ſome things to anſwer the Armies Petition, Order a releaſe of all Priſoners, who were not in a capacity to pay their Debts; the Commiſſion nevertheleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the ſeizure of all their Eſtate and Moveables, to pay as far as they will go. They likewiſe Enact a rebate in Uſury, that none ſhould take above ſix in the hundred, which is an eaſe to the poor, but a plague to the rich.</p>
               <p>The 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> arrives at <hi>London</hi> Maſter <hi>Belford</hi> from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who brings Letters expreſſing their high reſentment for the ſecuring of their Commiſſioners; they aſſure them that they owned the Paper ſent by their Commiſſioners, by ſending another Tranſcript of it; ſo their Commiſſioners are diſcharged, and it referred to the Counſell of State to ſend them an Anſwer.</p>

               <p>But the Lord Mayor and ſeverall of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, whoſe conſciences would not permit them to proclaim it, refuſing to do it, put a demur upon it throughout the whole Nation; the effects of which the Parliament fearing, called him to the Bar of the Houſe, and finding him reſolved, Order the degradation of him, Alderman <hi>Bunce,</hi> and three Aldermen more.

               <p>The 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Pomfret</hi> which had held out near nine Moneths, was forced to ſurrender for want of Ammunition. The private Souldiers who were moſt of them

               <p>The Scotch Commiſſioners are at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to the King, with full Inſtructions to treat with him; of which the chief were: <hi>Firſt, That his Majeſty take the Covenant, Secondly, That he put from him all who have aſſiſted his Father or him formerly; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Lord</hi> Montroſs. <hi>Thirdly, That he bring but</hi> 100 <hi>with him into</hi> Scotland. <hi>And fourthly, That he bring no forreign force into</hi> Scotland <hi>without their conſent.</hi> But whether theſe Conditions were by him agreed to or no, I think is hardly known.</p>

               <p>The Counſell of State begin now to take the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland</hi> into more ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to diſpatch relief the ſooner, Order that a convenient number of Shipping be made ready at <hi>Briſtoll, Leverpool, Beaumorris,</hi> and <hi>Milford Haven,</hi> to tranſport the Army, and to be at the direction of the Commander in chief for <hi>Ireland.</hi> They likewiſe give Order that an Hoſpitall be provided for maimed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in <hi>Dublin.</hi> That all thoſe who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the Parliaments pay in <hi>Ireland,</hi> do joyn with thoſe now ſent over, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Excellency the Lord Generall <hi>Cromwell.</hi> That Bread, Salt, Cheeſe, and other proviſions be provided, with a train of Artillery.

               <p>The ſale of the Deans and Chapters Lands coming under conſideration, were found worth 9000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>

                  <hi>per annum</hi> old Rent, which is to be ſold. But 1. It was reſolved that 300000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> be raiſed on it in way of doubling, as on Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Lands. 2. That no Bill of Faith paſs, but ſuch as hath been allowed by Truſtees. 3.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170564:29"/>upon a Sally as ſoon as he ſhould ſee occaſion, which the Enemy themſelves ſoon gave him, by coming down on the Eaſt ſide of the City, with a party of near 2000 Foot and ſome Horſe, intending to have run a trench along to the Sea, and there to have built a Fort which might have commanded the Haven, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſupplyes from <hi>England;</hi> they within per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their deſign, were reſolved to hinder them; ſo drawing out near twelve hundred Horſe and four thouſand Foot, couragiouſly enter thoſe trenches the Enemy had raiſed, and purſued their charge with ſo much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that <hi>Ormonds</hi> Horſe preſently gave back, and his Foot moſt cut in pieces, or taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which eaſie victory gave ſuch heat to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, that purſuing it with as much reſolution as poſſible could be expected in men, they followed the Chaſe as far as <hi>Rathmines,</hi> where <hi>Ormonds</hi> Company lay conſiſting of 19000 Horſe and Foot, whom finding ſecure and out of order, they charged ſo vigorouſly, that they ſoon put the whole body to the rout, purſuing them as far as the <hi>Naas, Ormond</hi> himſelf hardly eſcaping on Horſeback. In this Battell were above 3000 ſlain on the place, 2517 Priſoners taken, many men of quality, of which <hi>Ormonds</hi> own Brother was one, all their train of Artillery, Ammunition, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170564:29"/>taken, and a rich Camp left for the Souldiers to plunder. Thus was this great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of whom ſuch matters were expected, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and routed by a handfull of men, and with ſo ſmall a loſs, that it would ſcarce gain belief if mentioned.</p>
               <p>But let us leave <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſpeak a little of the affairs of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Scoth</hi> Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners at the <hi>Hague</hi> could not get the King to conſent as yet to a full agreement with their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> it ſeemed ſomewhat too harſh to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the Covenant, or condiſcend to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Church-Government by <hi>Preſbytery;</hi> nor could he either in honour or conſcience deſert thoſe Noble perſons, who had alwayes ſtuck faithfully both to himſelf and Father, for a Nation that had ſold his Father to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though now they courted him with golden promiſes; but eſpecially he could not tell how to part with <hi>Montroſs,</hi> who had ventured ſo far for him. Nor would the Commiſſioners, nor the States of <hi>Scotland</hi> themſelves upon any termes re-admit him, but upon the grant of thoſe Conditions. The <hi>King</hi> therefore (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſo much deſcent from his Honour) grants a Commiſſion to <hi>Montroſs</hi> to levy what Forces he could beyond Sea, and with them to go joyn with the Lord <hi>Seaforth,</hi> Major <hi>Straughan,</hi> and others who had got to a head
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170564:30"/>for the King without the Kirk, in the North of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but they were routed before he came by <hi>Leſley,</hi> and himſelf not long after his arrivall, defeated by a Party of the Kirks, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner, and moſt ignominiouſly hanged in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> which action next that of ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their King, muſt neceſſarily bring as much <hi>odium</hi> upon the <hi>Scottiſh Preſbyterians,</hi> as ever Sect was under.</p>
               <p>But let us return a little to <hi>England,</hi> where at length that turbulent Head-piece <hi>John Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> is brought to triall, the grand Champion of the Levellers, and indeed their only Patriot, a man of an undaunted ſpirit, neither to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred by threats, or won by favours. He was tried in <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> London, by a ſpeciall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> where moſt of the Judges and Juſtices of the Courts at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> the Lord Mayor, Sheriffs, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> were preſent. His Indictment contained many crimes of a treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable nature; chiefly being author of ſeverall ſcandalous reviling Pamphlets, againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Governours of the Nation, and particularly that entituled, <hi>The ſecond part of Englands new Chains;</hi> which contained moſt ſharp invectives againſt the Parliament, calling them <hi>Traytors, Tyrants, Murderers, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> telling them that they were wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170564:30"/>of <hi>Rebellion, Villany, Murder,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi> with a great deal of ſuch rabble; yet though theſe Books were verily believed his, the proofs not being clear, the Jury found him not guilty, whereupon he was acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>But let us return to ſee how the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Cromwels</hi> Army got over into <hi>Ireland.</hi> The generall Rendezvows being at <hi>Milford-Haven,</hi> they there had the news of the great victory over <hi>Ormonds</hi> Army, which no doubt diſpleaſed the Lord Generall, who had hopes to have had a ſhare in, or the whole glory of ſo great a victory; however he makes what haſt he can over, and himſelf <hi>Auguſt</hi> 13 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from <hi>Milford-Haven,</hi> with the Van of the Army in thirty two Ships; on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> Generall <hi>Ireton</hi> follows with the Main in fourty two Veſſels; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> brings up the rear in about twenty Sail. Favourable windes brought them ſoon to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Canons ecchoed forth the joy of their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall; but the Lord Deputy <hi>Cromwell</hi> being wholly addicted to action, ſtayed not long to receive thoſe entertainments, which the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Dublin</hi> gave, but having refreſhed his Army ſome time, draws out a Body of 15000 Horſe and Foot to a generall Muſter, out of which he ſelects twelve Regiments, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170564:31"/>9 or 1000 able and reſolute men for the preſent expedition, which he intends for <hi>Droghedah;</hi> and having furniſhed his Army with a train of Artillery, fit for the ſiege of ſo well fortified a place, marches on with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and being come near the Town (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of War) ſends a Summons to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Arthur Aſton</hi> Governour, but the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons prevailed little upon a perſon known to be ſo able a Souldier, and who had above 2000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen with him, who had moſt of them been formerly Commanders in the late Kings Army; but an anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, containing a reſolution to expire with the taking of the Town; whereupon the Lord Generall orders all things for the quickeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his deſign, which was to take the Town <hi>per</hi> force, ſince quick diſpatches muſt neceſſarily be the life of his buſineſs, the Winter drawing ſo nigh; and however ſhould that let be removed, yet if he ſhould ſtay the ſtarving it out, he ſhould give <hi>Ormond, Inche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen,</hi> &amp;c. time to raiſe an Army for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; the batteries therefore are planted to the beſt advantage, and play as furiouſly, ſo that in four hours ſpace it levelled the Steeple of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Maries</hi> Church, and a Tower by it; and continuing the next day after near five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drep Shot, the South-Eaſt Tower is beaten
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170564:31"/>down, and two very conſiderable breaches made, which are immediately entred by Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Caſtles, Huſons,</hi> and <hi>Ewers</hi> Regiments, Collonel <hi>Castle</hi> himſelf (which ſeldome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of like note uſe to do in a ſtorm) lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Van (by the Lord Deputy <hi>Cromwells</hi> ſpeciall Order, for what intent I'le leave to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to gueſs) where he was ſlain; the Charge on both ſides was ſo hot, as ſeldome the like hath been ſeen, the grapple being on both ſides at ſwords point (the only weapon to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) for near three hours ſpace, till the Aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were forced to retire, which <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſeeing, commands a freſh reſerve of Collonel <hi>Ewers</hi> his Regiment to aſſail the breach, (but others ſay that he entred himſelf, which is very hardly believed, he having too much wiſdome to be ſo deſperate) who meeting with wearied Defendants forced their way; though they met with a noble and heroick aſſiſtance, yet they gained a ſure poſſeſſion in the Town, though they could not yet ſubdue it, for S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Arthur Aſhtons</hi> men hotly diſputed every corner of the Street, ſo that the Aſſailants were forced to win what they did by ſmall degrees, till at laſt the ſupernumerary force of their enemies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their valour, they all were maſſacred by their mercileſs adverſary, the Lord Deputy <hi>Cromwell</hi> having given ſtrict Orders, not to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170564:32"/>allow Quarter either to Man, Woman; or Childe, which unparralleld cruelty, though it may finde excuſes amongſt men who delight in flattery, yet will it undoubtedly finde as cruell a reward from the moſt juſt God, who judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every mans actions impartially.</p>
               <p>Some there were who got into Steeples and other places of defence, thinking to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but were all forced either by the ſword or famine to yield, who yet in cold bloud found as little mercy, as their fellows had done in the heat of the Battell; there being not above two eſcaping with their lives, the Dean <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> afterwards made Almoner, and the other an old man by his leaping out of a Steeple, which <hi>Cromwels</hi> Souldiers blew up with Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, who though he broke his Leg, yet had his life ſaved. This great ſlaughter not being occaſioned neither by the heat of the Souldiers, but by <hi>Cromwels</hi> ſpeciall Command, who vowed ſomewhat to a noble Officer of his, (pleading for mercy for the Defendants) <hi>That he would ſacrifice their bodyes to the ſouls of the Engliſhmen they had murdered,</hi> which he could not in juſtice ſay of thoſe in <hi>Droghedah,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be moſt <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and ſuch whoſe greateſt fault was to ſerve their true and lawfull Soveraign in his juſt defence.</p>
               <p>However this ſlaughter works for his ends,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170564:32"/>for upon the News the Souldiers and Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Trim</hi> and <hi>Dundalke,</hi> (two adjacent Garriſons) quit their holds; and ſuch was their haſte in <hi>Trim,</hi> that they l ft their great Guns behinde them on the Platforms; and well might their fear be great at the News of <hi>Droghedahs</hi> taking, when S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Phelime O Neal</hi> at the hearing of it, burſt out in a paſſion ſwearing, <hi>That if</hi> Cromwell <hi>had taken</hi> Droghedah <hi>by ſtorm, if he ſhould ſtorm Hell, he would take it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This conſiderable action having had ſuch wiſhed for ſucceſs, <hi>Cromwell</hi> directs his Army towards <hi>Wexford,</hi> and in his way engarriſons <hi>Killingkerick</hi> and <hi>Arcklo</hi> Caſtle (the feat of the <hi>Ormonds</hi>) two deſerted Forts; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in that March ſubmitted, whereof moſt being places inconſiderable were ſlighted, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers engarriſoned.</p>
               <p>The firſt of <hi>October</hi> the Army faces <hi>Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and the Lord Deputy requires Collonel <hi>Synnot</hi> the Governour to make a ſpeedy ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it; he returnes an anſwer ſomewhat dubious, ſo that many Papers paſs between him and the Lord Deputy, which was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned only by a deſign the Governour had to waſte and delay time, till the Earl of <hi>Castle-haven</hi> was entred into the Town with 500 men to ſtrengthen the Garriſon. So when the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170564:33"/>Governour had received theſe recruits, he no longer writes dubiouſly, but plainly ſends word to the Lord Deputy, that he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſtand it out to the utmoſt; whereupon <hi>Cromwell</hi> being enraged at his mockery, bends his force at the Caſtle, which ſtands at the South-Eaſt end of the Town, which after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received ſome hundreds of great Shot, was forced to a rendition. This ſo quelled the hearts of the ſtout <hi>Wexfordians,</hi> that they quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Walls, and gave the Enemy free leave to enter, which they delayed not to do, but meeting with no reſiſtance, fell in pell mell till they came to the Market-place, where the Souldiers and Inhabitants reviving their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, in vain maintained their ground for a ſhort time, for they were ſoon over-powred, and all that were found in Arms, ſlain.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Wexford</hi> being taken, <hi>Cromwell</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es on to <hi>Waterford</hi> and takes <hi>Paſſage</hi>-Fort, but becauſe of the Winter, preſently raiſes his Army, and whileſt ſeverall parties are diſpoſed in their winter-quarters, they reduce ſeverall engarriſoned places, ſo that in fine all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable places in <hi>Ireland,</hi> except <hi>Limerick, Waterford, Clonmell, Galloway</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> were in the poſſeſſion of the Lord Deputy <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us leave him thus victorious in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:170564:33"/>and return to the King and <hi>Scots.</hi> The King ſeeing buſineſs go ſo ill in <hi>Ireland,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to comply ſomewhat neerer with the <hi>Scots,</hi> who (notwithſtanding his giving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to <hi>Montroſs</hi>) ſtill ſollicit him by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and at length come to agreement with him.</p>
               <p>The news of this, and the Scottiſh great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for warre, and as it is ſuppoſed to invade <hi>England,</hi> makes the Parliament ſend over to <hi>Ireland</hi> for their victorious Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> whom they intend to ſend into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to hinder their coming into <hi>England</hi> (Generall <hi>Fairfax</hi> having pleaded his diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to go:) but <hi>Cromwell</hi> before his coming away, he reduces the City of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and the ſtrong Fort of <hi>Clonmell,</hi> the one by Articles, the other by ſtorm: which done leaving <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Deputy in his ſtead, he takes Ship at <hi>Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and ſo came over to <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and from thence by Poſt to <hi>London,</hi> where upon Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the firſt of <hi>Iune,</hi> he arrived with unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible imaginations of joy.</p>
               <p>About this time Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> who had played many pranks at Sea, is blocked up by the three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admirals in <hi>Liſbone,</hi> (moſt of his Ships being before either taken or ſunk) who treat with the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> to force him out of his harbour, which he by no
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170564:34"/>means, neither promiſes nor threats, could be induced to do, though the Engliſh ſurprize many of his Sugar-Ships coming from <hi>Brazill,</hi> and threaten to take the reſt in caſe he reſolves not to renounce his protection of Prince <hi>Rupert;</hi> but at laſt the Engliſh for want of water and victuals, are forced to depart from before the Port; which opportunity Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, gets out and ſteers for <hi>Malaga;</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Engliſh having victualled follow them, take the <hi>Roe-Buck,</hi> force the <hi>Black-Prince</hi> and four more aſhore, and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> eſcaping with two Ships more, they ſleight him, and giving over further ſearch, return with victory to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time likewiſe the Engliſh having ſent M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>The League and agreement being as I ſaid before fully concluded between the Scots and the King, ſo that there wanted nothing but their having him with them, which to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite, he haſtens from <hi>Breda,</hi> comes to the <hi>Hague;</hi> and there takes ſhipping; from whence, notwithſtanding the wait laid for him, he arrives ſafely at the <hi>Spey</hi> in the north of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he is received with the beſt entertainment the Scots could give him.</p>
               <p>But before he aſcend the Throne, there are other Conditions to be agreed on, which they told him not of before; 1. He muſt take the <hi>ſolemn League and Covenant.</hi> 2. He muſt ſubſcribe to a <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Kirks own framing; declaring, <hi>That he renounced the ſins of his Fathers houſe, and of his own; the Idolatry of his Mother, by a conſtant adhering to the Cauſe of God according to the Covenant, in the firm eſtabliſhment of Church-government, as it is laid down in the Directory of publique Worſhip, Confeſſion of Faith and Catechiſme.</hi> Theſe and many other bitter Pills was he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take, to purge him and make him fit for that Crown which was ſhortly after put upon his head.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:170564:35"/>
               <p>And now the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> begin to think of their ſecurity, and for fear of an invaſion from the <hi>Scots,</hi> reſolve to invade the <hi>Scots;</hi> they therefore order the Armies ſpeedy advance, which preſently allarms the <hi>Scots;</hi> they ſend two or three Papers to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 22. 1650, The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army quit their Quarters at <hi>Barwicke,</hi> and advance into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as far as the Lord <hi>Mordingtons</hi> houſe; ſo they are now the firſt invaders; thence on to <hi>Copperſpeth,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> where they receive proviſions from their Ships, and ſo march to <hi>Haddington.</hi>

               <p>At <hi>Haddington</hi> the Lord Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> hearing that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army would meet him next at <hi>Gladmoore,</hi> endeavours to poſſeſs the <hi>Moore</hi> before them, but no conſiderable Party

               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> march off quietly to <hi>Muſſelbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> but very much tired and faint for want of proviſions, and by lying open in the rain, that they expected the Enemy ſhould fall upon them in the night, which they did, broke through the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guards, and put a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe to diſorder; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſallying, and the whole Army taking the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, charged, routed, and purſued thoſe fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Troops under Command of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and <hi>Straughan:</hi> Theſe loſſes made the <hi>Scots</hi> keep cloſer in their trenches.</p>

               <p>In the mean time affairs go on well for the Parliament in <hi>Ireland; Teoroghan</hi>-Caſtle not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſtour reſiſtance of the Lady Governeſs, is at laſt compelled to yield: <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford</hi> before which the Lord Deputy <hi>Ireton</hi> was ſet down, was in a yielding capacity: <hi>Ormonds, Castlehavins,</hi> and other royall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſperſed, ſo that there now remained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Limericke, Galloway,</hi> and ſome other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Garriſons, to the wholly reducing that Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Somewhat before this the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Caribdy</hi> Iſland, revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their obedience to the Parliament, and declare unanimouſly for Monarchy and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, but the decay of their Trade (without which they could not long ſubſiſt) and a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Ships ſent under the Command of Sir <hi>George Askew,</hi> quickly reduces them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance.</p>
               <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> the more to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the <hi>Scots,</hi> and encreaſe their miſery, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite all traffick with them, command all their Merchants and Ships to depart in ten dayes, who going without Convoy, moſt of them fall into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frigots, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they could make no reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>Collonel <hi>Euſebius Andrews</hi> being taken

               </p>
               <p>But to digreſs: The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a deſign to enlarge his power over the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Provinces, is impeaded by the City of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> whereupon he endeavours to ſurprize it: but the Burgers having advice of it, by letting open their ſluces forbid the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his Army, ſo his deſign failing, he came off with diſgrace; but they afterwards came to an agreement, and the Prince was forced to be content with the power he had before, or leſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army in <hi>Scotland</hi> (to which it is time to return) having taken <hi>Collington</hi>-houſe, and <hi>Readhall</hi> by ſtorm, and in the laſt the Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Major <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and good ſtore of Ammunition, and proviſion, move from <hi>Pentland-hills,</hi> and <hi>Collington,</hi> and <hi>Readhall,</hi> within a Mile of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army; both Armyes march ſide by ſide in view of each other, but a Bog betwixt them hindred an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, but the great Guns played on both ſides, which nevertheleſs provoked not the

                  <hi>Scotch</hi> to fight, but ſtill they kept under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Bog, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeeing, retreated and marcht to <hi>Muſleborough</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves; which done, they draw off and march to <hi>Haddington:</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> attending their right wing, fall on deſperately, but are repulſed by Collonel <hi>Fairfaxes</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>September</hi> 1. 1650, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> whither the <hi>Scots</hi> followed them, and drew up their whole Army upon a high Hill, within a Mile of the Town: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army drew up in a Corn-field below, being encamped on a neck of Land, not a Mile and half from the Sea to Sea; ſo that the <hi>Scots</hi> Army being above them, and finding their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, endeavoured the gaining of <hi>Copper-ſpeth-paſs,</hi> which effected, they bragged they had the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi> his pound; and <hi>Leſly</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Generall bragged he would have the <hi>Engliſh</hi> either dead or alive.</p>
               <p>The ſtraits of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were very great, many ſick and diſabled, and themſelves pen't up in this manner wanting proviſions; they reſolved on the third of <hi>September,</hi> either to force their way through their Enemies, or die nobly in the attempt; a Party of Horſe is firſt ſet to gain the paſs, which effected, the whole Army charged, and after about an hours hot

The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Army were not above 7500 Foot and 3500 Horſe, beſides diſabled men. There was taken from the Scots neer 200 Foot and Horſe Colours, 27 Fieldpieces, 10000 Arms, and many Priſoners of note; amongſt which were the Lords <hi>Liberton, Lumſdale</hi> and <hi>Grandiſon.</hi>

               <p>This relation gives me occaſion to give you ſome heads of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Letter to the Speaker, wherein the Reader may pleaſe to obſerve his religious canting, and judg themſelves if they would not have took him for a Saint. Having given a relation of the fight and victory, he craves leave to add a few words, of which theſe are part, <hi>viz. It is eaſie to ſay the Lord hath done this it would do you good to ſee and hear our poor Foot go up and down making their boaſt of God; but S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, it is in your hands, and by this eminent mercy God puts it more in your hands, to improve your power and his bleſſings to his praiſe; we that ſerve you beg of you, not to own us but God alone. We pray you own his people more and more, for they are the Chariots and horſemen of Iſraell; diſown your ſelves, but own your authority, and improve it, to curb the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170564:38"/>Proud and the inſolent, ſuch as would diſturb the tranquility of</hi> England, <hi>though under what specious pretences foever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Again, Since we came into</hi> Scotland, <hi>it hath been our deſire and longing, to have avoided bloud in this buſineſs, by reaſon that God hath a people here fearing his Name though much deceived, and to that end we have offered much love to ſuch in the bowels of Christ; and concerning the truth of our hearts therein we have appealed unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and more, this is the great hand of the Lord, and worthy the conſideration of all thoſe, who taking into their hands the inſtruments of a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſhepheard, to wit, medling with worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, and mixtures of earthly power, to ſet up that which they call the Kingdom of Chriſt, which is neither it, and if it were, would ſuch means be found effectuall to that end, and neglect or truſt not to the Word of God, the Sword of the Spirit, which is alone powerfull and able for the ſetting up of that Kingdom, and when truſted to will be found effectually able for that end, and will alſo do it. This is humbly offered for their ſakes, who have lately too much turned aſide, that they might turn again to preach JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST according to the ſimplicity of the Goſpell,</hi> &amp;c. If this man could not diſſemble well, who ever did?</p>
               <p>The Parliament ordered, that the Scottiſh
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170564:38"/>Colours taken from Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> at <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and thoſe ſent from <hi>Dunbar,</hi> taken at the now recited battell, ſhould be hanged up in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> hall, the one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>About this time died in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> third Daughter to the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> who had her Funerall rights performed in <hi>Newport</hi> Church in the ſame Iſland, Tueſed <hi>Sept.</hi> 24. preſently after which the Parliament gave order for the ſending of <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> her Brother to the Univerſity at <hi>Heidelberg</hi> (a Town of the Prince Electors) where the Parliament ordered him an allowance of 1500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the mean time by the care and pains of the Lord Deputy <hi>Ireton, Munſter</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> are reduced to obedience, except ſome Tories which ſtand out and lie ſculcking in the woods and faſtneſſes. <hi>Waterford</hi> being ſurrendred, there was nothing now left towards the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of that Countrey but <hi>Connaught;</hi> to which effect <hi>Limerick</hi> as the paſs into it was blockt up Deputy <hi>Ireton.</hi> But let us by a little leave theſe affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affairs of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Victory won at <hi>Dunbarr,</hi> the Scots not only loſe all their Arms and Artillery in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170564:39"/>Camp, but likewiſe quitted <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burrough;</hi> whereupon the Lord Generall the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Septemb.</hi> ſends four Regiments to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Leith</hi> (where they found 37 Guns mounted on the Platforms, ſome ſhot, and ſtore of Ammunition) and the ſame day <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> draws the reſt of the Army into <hi>Edenbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> without any loſs, ſave the Arm of a Souldier, though the Caſtle plaid hot upon them.</p>
               <p>After the Army had ſpent ſome time in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying <hi>Leith,</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> had by beat of Drum and ſound of Trumpet proclaimed a Protection of Markets, and liberty of Trade in <hi>Edinborrough</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi> the Army advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards <hi>Sterling,</hi> whither moſt of the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Nobility and Gentry had retired from <hi>Edenborrough</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi>) and <hi>Septemb.</hi> 18. being within a mile of the Town, a Counſell of Warre was called, and a Summons reſolved to be ſent, for its ſurrender to the ſervice of the Commonwealth of <hi>England;</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly a Trumpeter was ſent with a Letter, who being come near the Town, was met by a Gentleman on foot, with a Pike in his hand, who told him that he would neither let him come in, nor receive his Letter.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Scots ſent our a Trumpet, deſiring a releaſe of Priſoners upon ranſome;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170564:39"/>but Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> returned anſwer, That he came not thither to make merchandize of men, but for the ſervice and ſecurity of the Commonwealth of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Summons ſent to <hi>Sterling</hi> not being received, cauſed Orders to be given for the getting of Ladders and all things neceſſary for a ſtorm; but upon ſecond thoughts, the ſtrength of the Enemy and dangers being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it was agreed that the Army ſhould draw off, which accordingly they did and marched to <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> which place lying between <hi>Edinborrough</hi> and <hi>Sterling,</hi> being judged fitting to be made a Garriſon of, the Generall ordered to be fortified, and leaving in it five Troops of Horſe and ſix Companies of Foot, marched with the reſt to <hi>Edinbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Sept.</hi> 23. the afflicted Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> appointed a ſolemn day of Faſting and Humiliation; 1. To humble themſelves for their too much confidence in the arm of fleſh. 2. For the malignity and prophaneſs of their Army. 3. For the plunderings and wickedneſs of their Army when they were in <hi>England.</hi> 4. For their not ſufficient purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Army. 5. For their Commiſſioners unlawfull and ſurreptitious manner of proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Treaty with their King, and their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170564:40"/>crooked wayes in bringing him home. 6. For their not ſufficient purging the Kings houſe. 7. For the juſt grounds they have to beleeve his Majeſties repentance was not ſound nor from the heart.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to beget a right underſtanding with thoſe that diſſented from the King but ſtood for the Kirk, <hi>viz.</hi> Coll. <hi>Kerre</hi> and <hi>Straughan,</hi> and their adherents for there were three factions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> viz. one in the North was for the King without the Kirk; another party in the Weſt, was for the Kirk without the King; the third was for King and Kirk, and theſe were they then at <hi>Sterling,</hi> who bore the greateſt ſway, <hi>viz.</hi> The Committee of Eſtates and Generall Aſſembly. To Coll. <hi>Kerr,</hi> &amp;c. Commiſ. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Whalley</hi> is ſent with a party, but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſts them firſt with a Letter, declaring, <hi>That it was not unknown what amicable wayes they had uſed to avoid the effuſion of Chriſtian blood before and ſince they came into</hi> Scotland, <hi>which though hitherto hath been ineffectuall, yet they ſhould endeavour the ſame.</hi> Shewing further, <hi>That their arms were ſtill ſtretched out to imbrace them, when ever God ſhould incline them to come in, and that they ſought not dominion over them to enſlave them, nor to depreſs their Kirk Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, neither that they ſought to have their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170564:40"/>goods or eſtates, but to carry on the Lords work, &amp;c.</hi> with a great deal of ſuch like ſtuff.</p>
               <p>To this Letter Coll. <hi>Kerre</hi> ſends an Anſwer to Commiſ. Gen. <hi>Whalley</hi> in very ſhort terms, telling him, <hi>That though they were not in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to act againſt the Engliſhmens unjuſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; yet they were in a capacity to ſuffer, and ſhould ſubmit to Gods will either by doing or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, till the time of their deliverance came: that if it were their happineſs to periſh in their duty, it would be a ſufficient mercy to them, and when the perſecution had arrived to its height, their captivity ſhould be returned. Adding, that he thought it ſtrange the Engliſh ſhould talk of a ceſſation, whileſt they were captivating their poor people, aſſaulting their Garriſons, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending their Miniſters, tearing them from their holy callings and from their holy ſighing ſtocks; concluding the departure of the Engliſh out of that Kingdome, and then deſiring a Chriſtian Treaty, would be a great favour and mercy equally as great to the one as the other; that in the mean time he ſhould ſtand upon his guard and expect no further overtures of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to digreſs a little: About the latter end of this moneth of <hi>October</hi> departed this life the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who had lately endeavoured to curb the High and Mighty States; in him King <hi>Charles</hi> loſt his greateſt intereſt he had in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170564:41"/>thoſe parts. His Princeſs ſome ten days after his death was delivered of a young Prince, which in part mitigated the grief for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death.</p>
               <p>But let us look a little into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Dungan</hi> and <hi>Scurlog</hi> having gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neer 500 Horſe and Foot, met with a party of the Parliaments Army of about 300, charged them, and overpowring them in Horſe routed them, ſlew 50 upon the place, took neer 40 Priſoners, and had carried them into the Woods, had not Captain <hi>Eſſex</hi> with about 50 Horſe, 20 Dragoons, and 100 Foot come to their reſcue; the body of the Engliſh Army lay before <hi>Limerick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return again to <hi>Scotland: Cromwell</hi> ſeeing that Peace would not be hearkned to, diſpoſes his Army to the Warre; Major <hi>Brown</hi> with a party takes in <hi>Dalhouſe,</hi> a ſuppoſed harbour of Moſs-Troopers, of which ſort of vermine he took divers in <hi>Darlington</hi> houſe, whom he cauſed to be ſhot upon the place. Collonel <hi>Monk</hi> is ſent with a party to reduce <hi>Roſelane</hi> Caſtle, which with the help of ſome Granadoes he makes yeeld to mercy. Major Generall <hi>Lambert</hi> marches to <hi>Dunfreez</hi> to joyn with <hi>Whalley</hi> (who had taken <hi>Dalkeith</hi> Caſtle by a terrible ſummons in his march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Kerre</hi> and <hi>Straughan.</hi> This Caſtle wall
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170564:41"/>was thirteen foot broad at the top, and well ſtored with Ammunition and Proviſion.</p>
               <p>Collonel <hi>Kerre</hi> was now about <hi>Beebles: Lambert</hi> having with much difficulty marched over the River to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> reſolves to quarter there that night; which <hi>Kerre</hi> hearing, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to beat up his quarters, and if poſſible ſurprize the Major Generall; this he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great deal of reſolution, but the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh taking the Alarme intime, on a ſodaine encompaſſed moſt of the enemies Horſe, killed 100, took 100, beſides 400 Horſe and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture forſook of their Riders, thereſt they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued as far as <hi>Ayre;</hi> in the which purſuit Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Kerre</hi> was was taken, and ſeverall of his Officers. This defeat cauſed <hi>Straughan</hi> to come in, who was with the reſt carried by the Major Generall to the head Quarters. <hi>Cromwell</hi> all this while ſtrongly beſieges the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburrough,</hi> yet his mines prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall in that hard Rock; ſo that he cauſes an artificiall Mount to be raiſed, whereon to plant his battery, ſo that his Canons and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes flew thick and three-fold at the Caſtle, at which the Defendants at firſt hung out a red Flag in defiance, but after a ſhort time hung out a white one for Parley, which was accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and after a great many Meſſages to and fro, ſurrendred, upon Articles agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170564:42"/>Major <hi>Abernethe</hi> and Captain <hi>Hynder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> on the part of the Caſtle, and Collonel. <hi>Monck</hi> and Liev. Coll. <hi>White</hi> on the Generals, to this effect: Firſt, <hi>That the Caſtle be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to his Excellency on the</hi> 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, <hi>with all the Arms, Magazine and furniture of warre thereto belonging. That the Governour with all the Officers and Souldiers ſhould then march forth with their Arms, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours flying, Drums beating, Matches light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Bullet in mouth, whether they ſhall think fit. That ſuch adjacent Inhabitants as had Goods in the Caſtle, ſhould have them reſtored; and to that purpoſe they had liberty from the</hi> 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                  <hi>of</hi> December <hi>to fetch them away.</hi> The ſodain rendition of ſo ſtrong a hold as this was, made the world beleeve, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons plaid upon it with Silver inſtead of Iron ſhot.</p>
               <p>About this time there was a kind of petty Inſurrection in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> by a company of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable perſons, who declared for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Popery, reſtoring King <hi>Charles</hi> to his Crown, revenge of his Fathers death, and for rooting out of hereſie and ſchiſme; but being only begun by a diſorderly number, they were ſoon vanquiſhed, and the principall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers about 20 in number executed.</p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Henry Hide</hi> having received a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

                  <hi>Thomas Bendiſh,</hi> then Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, and the Caſe being heard before the <hi>Vizier,</hi> the Verdict was given on <hi>Bendiſh</hi> his ſide; ſo that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Harry Hide</hi> was forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Port, whence coming to <hi>Smyrnd,</hi> with an intention to go for <hi>Venice,</hi> he was by a wile invited on board a Ship to a Feaſt, was treacherouſly brought away to <hi>England,</hi> and here beheaded before the <hi>Royall Exchange,</hi> for having taken Commiſſions from that King.</p>
               <p>The Winter being now at the height, made the War in <hi>Scotland</hi> at a ſtand on the Engliſh part; but the Scots having now as they thought throughly purged their King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to his Coronation, which was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Scone,</hi> with as much Solemnity and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, as their neceſſities would permit, on the firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1651.</p>
               <p>The King crowned, they proceed to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of <hi>Straughan, Swinton,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who had deſerted them, and were gone in to the Engliſh; they then ſtrive to pacifie diſſenting parties, and paſs an Act for new Levies throughout the Nation. The King is likewiſe created Generall of this Army now
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170564:43"/>intended to be levied, with an unuſuall kinde of Ceremony, <hi>viz.</hi> by croſſing a Pike, Musket, Carabine, and Sword over his Head. <hi>Lothian Carre</hi> is made Major Generall; and <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Lieutenant Generall, <hi>David Leſley</hi> having layn down his Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh now beginning to ſtir, Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Fenwicke</hi> is commanded to march with two Regiments of Horſe and Foot, for reducing of <hi>Hume</hi>-Caſtle; who having faced it, ſent a Summons to the Governour, to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned an anſwer; the capriciouſneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of makes me inſert both.

               <p>But after the great Guns had played a little, and a ſmall breach was made, at which <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks</hi> men were ready to enter, he was forced to ſurrender the Caſtle upon Quarter for life, of which Captain <hi>Collinſon</hi> with his Company
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170564:44"/>took poſſeſſion. Collonel <hi>Moncke</hi> likewiſe though in ſomewhat longer time had the ſame fortune with three Regiments of Horſe and Foot in reducing <hi>Timptallon</hi>-Caſtle, (which had many times cut off Paſſengers, and done no little harm to the Country by frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions,) the Governour and Souldiers find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other Conditions, being forced to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render to mercy.</p>
               <p>But to give ſome ſtop to the Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> was taken with a violent Feaver, which confined him many dayes to his Chamber, inſomuch that it was generally voted up and down the Scoth Camp that he was dead, but a Trumpeter coming to <hi>Edinborough</hi> from <hi>Fife</hi> (to demand reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Ship laden with goods, which was taken by the Engliſh Frigots, going from <hi>Brunt</hi> Iſland to <hi>Fife</hi>) and there confidently averring to the Souldiers that their Generall was dead; which coming to <hi>Cromwels</hi> ears, he cauſed the Trumpeter to be brought before him, and not only gave him aſſurance of his life, but of his recovery in great meaſure, which at his return cauſed no ſmall decreaſe of joy in the Scotch Army.</p>
               <p>Generall <hi>Dean</hi> about this time arrived at <hi>Leith,</hi> with a Squadron of Engliſh Ships, bringing with him a convenient quantity of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170564:44"/>ſupplies both of men, Money, and proviſions, together with twenty ſeven flat bottomed Boats for tranſportation of the Army over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Fife,</hi> ſo extreamly carefull were the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of their Army in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Scotch Levies go on vigorouſly; <hi>Middleton</hi> marches out of the <hi>High-lands</hi> with a conſiderable number both of Horſe and Foot. The Town of <hi>Dundee</hi> to ſhew their affection to his Majeſty, advanced a brave Regiment of Horſe at their own charge, and ſent them with ſix braſs pieces of Ordnance, for a preſent to their King at <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe things were acting in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there happened a very ſtrange accident at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> One <hi>Anne Green</hi> ſervant to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Thomas Read,</hi> having been got with Childe by a Gentleman of the Houſe, about the fourth Moneth of her time, by over-working fell in travell, and not knowing what it might be, went to the Houſe of Office, where with ſome ſtraining, an abortive Infant of about a ſpan long fell from her, which being found out, ſhe was carried priſoner to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there condemned for the Murther, and hanged: After ſhe had hung near an hour, (all which time ſhe was pulled by the Legs, and ſtrook on the Breſt by ſome of her friends, and ſome
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170564:45"/>Souldiers that ſtood by with the But ends of their Muskets:) ſhe was cut down, put into a Coffin, and brought to a houſe to be diſſected by ſome Phyſicians; when they opened the Coffin, they perceived a ratling in her Throat, whereupon one ſtanding by ſtamped on her Breſt and Belly; but D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Petty</hi> and two other Doctors preſent, fell ſpeedily to uſe ſome meanes to bring her to life, which they did to the wonder of all men; ſhe ſtill as upon the Gallows averring her innocency.</p>
               <p>The Parliament now to aboliſh the ſhadow, as well as formerly they had done the ſubſtance of Monarchy, cauſe the Statuas of the late King, which were ſet up at the Weſt end of the Cathedrall of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> Church; aed that ſet up in the <hi>Royall Exchange,</hi> to be pulled down; and over the conſpicuous place of the laſt, cauſed this ignominious, <hi>Motto</hi> to be ſet:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exit Tyrannus Regum ultimus, anno liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis Angliae reſtitutae primo. Anno Domini</hi> 1648. January 30. which might far better be inverted.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe cauſe the Kings Arms in all places of the Kingdome to be defaced and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged, the Souldiers uſing all violence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to his Majeſties Pictures, though but ſet up for Signs.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:170564:45"/>
               <p>In the mean time the Parliament are courted by ſeverall forreign Ambaſſadors from the <hi>Hollander, Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting peace and amity; though 'tis ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the <hi>Hollander</hi> then intended a War.</p>
               <p>But however the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſend over <hi>Oliver S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John,</hi> and <hi>Walter Strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Eſquires, as Ambaſſadors extraordinary to <hi>Holland,</hi> where they were entertained with a great deal of Ceremony. The heads of their Ambaſſage was, 1. <hi>That a firme league and confederacy be made between the two Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi> 2. <hi>That former treaties and agreements of trade and commerce be renewed.</hi> 3. <hi>That the States of</hi> Holland <hi>would make ſtrict ſearch after the Murderers of Dr</hi> Doriſlaus; <hi>and that like affronts might be prevented for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the States had put out a Declaration, commanding that none ſhould upon ſtrict amercements affront the Engliſh Ambaſſadors; yet three Moneths were paſt, and nothing agreed upon, but innumerable affronts received; the Ambaſſadors by Order of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> returned home, <hi>infect â pace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Van Trumps</hi> lying hovering with his Fleet of <hi>Scilly,</hi> made the Engliſh Jealous that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170564:46"/>they intended ſome hoſtile attempt upon the place; but the reaſon of his hovering being demanded, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> anſwered, that they only lay there to demand ſatisfaction for ſuch Ships, as thoſe Pirates had taken from their people, which ſatisfied for the preſent; however the Parliament thought good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe Iſles under their own obedience, which they ſhortly after did, by a Fleet under Command of Admirall <hi>Blake,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Askew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Cornet</hi>-Caſtle in the Iſle of <hi>Guernſey,</hi> which ſtill held out with a Party for the King, was aſſaulted by a conſiderable Party of Foot, upon information given that there was but Forty men in the Caſtle, and eighteen of them diſabled, when upon tryal there was found ſixty good men in the Caſtle, who made hot work for the aſſailants, breaking their Ladders, and killing many of them with Caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot from the Flankers, ſo that they were fain to get off by the Boat, which proved as unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, two Boats full of Souldiers being ſunk by Shot from the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Browne Buſhell,</hi> a Noble Royaliſt, who had done many handſome actions for the ſervice of both the Kings, was beheaded under the Scaffold at <hi>Tower-hill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Forces under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170564:46"/>of the Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſcatter and diſperſe thoſe Forces raiſed by <hi>Caſtle-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Clanrickard, Dillon,</hi> and others, in the Counties of <hi>Kerryathlone, Monaghan,</hi> and <hi>Wicklow,</hi> and ſettle ſeverall Garriſons, to the diſtraction of moſt of their Enemies; no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable places being left to them but only <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick</hi> and <hi>Galloway.</hi> That conſiderable Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Finnagh</hi> in <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> being ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to Commiſſary Generall <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and <hi>Phelim Mac Hugh,</hi> who came with 1500 Horſe and Foot to its relief, routed, moſt of his Company ſlain, and many conſiderable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers taken priſoners.</p>
               <p>But let us return again to the main buſineſs in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Collonel <hi>Moncke</hi> with a Party of Horſe and Foot marches towards <hi>Blackneſs,</hi> a Garriſon of the Scots, which had much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammaged the Engliſh Quarters; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Batteries raiſed, and ſome Shot was ſpent, was reduced, the Defendants craving Quarter, which (conſidering the ſtrength of the place) was granted.</p>
               <p>The Scots in the mean time grow powerfull; for notwithſtanding all the ſtrifes and emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt them, an agreement is patcht up, to the ſeeming ſatisfaction of all the diſſenters; they are likewiſe in hopes of a power to riſe for them in <hi>Lanchaſhire,</hi> which with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170564:47"/>Party promiſed from <hi>Scotland</hi> to joyn with them, might confront any force of the Parliaments; but the deſign is diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was acted, and <hi>Thomas Cooke</hi> Eſquire of <hi>Grays-Inne</hi> the principall Agent for <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> taken.</p>
               <p>Major Generall <hi>Harriſon</hi> upon theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries is ſent into the North with a Body of Horſe and Foot, and to oppoſe the Enemy if he ſhould make an invade, by way of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The above-mentioned plot was contrived throughout all <hi>England,</hi> though by ill fortune timely prevented; ſeverall perſons of quality, but moſt Presbyterian Divines were taken, <hi>viz.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>Gibbons,</hi> who after many delays were beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> the 22. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1651.</p>
               <p>There hapned much about this time a petty riſing in <hi>Wales,</hi> two or three hundred perſons
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170564:47"/>being gathered together in behalf of the Scots King, upon a report that the Engliſh Army was routed, and the Scotch advancing into <hi>England;</hi> but the deſign proved as void of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as the report was of truth.</p>
               <p>But the Scots make ſeverall in-falls upon the Out-guards and Garriſons of the Engliſh, wherein they had frequently good ſucceſs, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſome, and taking others, having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Engliſh in the knowledge of the Country, which makes the Engliſh contract their Quarters, drawing away the Out-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and putting the Army into a poſture to march to <hi>Fife;</hi> but the Ground not yet afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Graſs or Oats, the enterprize was for the preſent ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>The Scotch Levies were now compleated to 15000 Foot and 6000 Horſe, with which they march on this ſide <hi>Sterling,</hi> to a place called <hi>Torwood,</hi> where the King drew up moſt of his Horſe and Foot, and enrails them in a regular fortification. <hi>Cromwell</hi> draws up his Army towards them, and marched in Battalia within view of their Camp, in hopes to draw them to a Fight; but they got nothing elſe from them, then ſome thundring Meſſengers from their great Artillery.</p>
               <p>The Lord Generall vext at their delays, fals upon <hi>Kalendar-houſe,</hi> kept by a Party of theirs,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170564:48"/>and in the end though it was ſtoutly defended out of hopes of relief, takes it by ſtorm; but when this neither would provoke the Scots to fight, he reſolves now having ſo fit an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to do that which he had ſo long inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>viz.</hi> to land ſome men on <hi>Fife;</hi> and accordingly Collonel <hi>Daniells</hi> Regiment of Foot having four Companies more joyned to it, and four Troops of Horſe, all under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Collonel <hi>Overton,</hi> being imbarqued at <hi>Leith,</hi> under pretence of being ſent for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> arrived next morning on the other ſhore, landed and intrenched in deſpite of a Party of Scots which ſtrove to oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>This News brought to the Lord Generall, Major Generall <hi>Lambert</hi> is preſently ordered with two Regiments of Horſe and two of Foot to ſecond them, which they did; but advice of it arriving in the Scotch Camp ſo alarm'd them, that in all haſte Major Generall <hi>Brown</hi> is ſent with four Regiments of Horſe and four of Foot, to drive the Engliſh out, which they might have done had not Major Generall <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> been arrived before them. So there being now almoſt an equall force, the Fight began to the great loſs of the Scots, whereof near 1500 were ſlain, 1000 taken priſoners, among which S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Brown,</hi> Major Generall was one,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170564:48"/>who ſhortly after (as 'tis ſuppoſed) out of grief for this defeat, died.</p>
               <p>Upon this overthrow the Scotch Army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their Camp from <hi>Torwood,</hi> and march directly to <hi>Sterling</hi>-Park. <hi>Cromwell</hi> follows in their rear, hoping yet to draw them to a Battell, but they would by no means be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it, though he followed them within two Miles of <hi>Sterling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord Generall perceiving his delays would be in vain, marches with his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Lithgoe,</hi> whence he ſends over into <hi>Fife</hi> the greateſt part of them, with the train of Artillery, to proſecute the War on the other ſide; the remainder with him being only four Regiments of Horſe and four of Foot, which he made uſe of to ſecure what was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gained, and obſerve the Scots moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> faces <hi>Brunt</hi> Iſland, which is ſurrendred upon Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, without diſcharging ſo much as one piece of Artillery.</p>
               <p>The Lord Generall likewiſe having diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe affairs which detained him at <hi>Leith,</hi> croſſes the Frith, and coming to the Army, draws them into a poſture; and having left Colonel <hi>Weſts</hi> Regiment in <hi>Brunt</hi> Iſland, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with the reſt towards S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Johnſton,</hi> and in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170564:49"/>two dayes faces the Town, and being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there was no Garriſon in it, he ſends a Summons to the Inhabitants, not doubting of a ſuddain rendition, but it proved otherwiſe: for the Lord <hi>Dafferes</hi> had the day before entred the Town with 1300 Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The Lord Generall hereupon ſends another Summons to the Governour, who ſullenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns him no anſwer; but after the Artillery had played one day, his ſtomack came down, and the Town was ſurrendred upon Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Army being marched as far North as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Johns</hi> Town, the King ſeeing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs go ſo deſperately in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and loath to loſe ſo good an opportunity, advances with his whole Army conſiſting of about 16000, and marches with all ſpeed poſſible into <hi>England</hi> by way of <hi>Carliſle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſuddain and unexpected action ſtartled the whole Engliſh Nation, but eſpecially the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who though they had doubting ſuch a thing, ordered Major Generall Harriſon with 3000 Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons to attend ſuch an irruption, yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him unable to encounter ſo great a Body, they could not tell what the event might be; they therefore proceed to the leavying of new Forces in all the Counties of <hi>England;</hi> and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170564:49"/>likewiſe for the better carrying on of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, Enact, <hi>That no perſon whatſoever ſhould preſume to hold any correſpondency with</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>or with his party, or with any of them, nor give any intelligence to them, nor countenance, encourage, abett, adhere to or aſſist any of them, nor voluntarily afford, or cauſe to be afforded or delivered to any of them any victuals, proviſion, Ammunition, Arms, Horſes, Plate, Money, Men, or any other relief whatſoever, under pain of high Treaſon; and that all perſons ſhould uſe their utmost endeavours to hinder and ſtop their march.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet for all this the Scotch Army went on in proſecution of their deſign, bending their courſe by a ſwift March for the Weſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> though it was expected by the whole Nation, and eſpecially by their friends, that they would have directed their courſe to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> being at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Johnſton,</hi> and hearing of this ſuddain march, leaving ſuch Forces as might ſecure that part of <hi>Scotland</hi> which was already won, and leaving ſix or ſeaven thouſand Horſe and Foot more with Lieutenant Generall <hi>Monck</hi> to reduce thoſe parts which remained; he orders Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Lambert</hi> with five Regiments of Horſe and Dragoons to fly away with all poſſible ſpeed to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170564:50"/>get into the rear of the Scots Army, whileſt <hi>Harriſon</hi> was in the Front, aad with the reſt of the Army followes as hard as he could, and on the 12 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> croſſed the Tine; but let us leave him following the Scotch Army, and look a little into the affairs of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                  <hi>Limerick</hi> though for ſome time blockt up, yet held out ſtoutly againſt the Forces of the Lord Deputy <hi>Ireton,</hi> they ſtill relying upon the Lord <hi>Muskerryes</hi> help for relief, who at length having gathered an Army of near 1000 Horſe and Dragoons and 2000 Foot, had an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to joyn with ſome Forces which were got together in <hi>Lemſter;</hi> but the Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> hearing of his deſign with about 400 Horſe and Dragoons and 1000 Foot, endeavoured to hinder compaction, ſo there hapned an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement between them, which though it was bloudy to the Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> (himſelf likewiſe being indangered) yet in the end he obtained full victory over the Lord <hi>Musker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi> Forces, of whom there were neer 600 ſlain, many of them Officers, but very few taken; there were likewiſe neer 200 of the Lord <hi>Broghills</hi> ſlain, and many wounded, the diſpute being very hot on both ſides; yet this ſtartled not at all either <hi>Limerick</hi> or <hi>Galloway,</hi> which were both beleaguered, and reſolved to hold out to the uttermoſt bit of bread.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:170564:50"/>
               <p>But let us return to ſee how the <hi>Scots</hi> direct their March in <hi>England,</hi> where being come to <hi>Warrington</hi> Bridge, <hi>Harriſon</hi> endeavours to impead their paſſage, but in vain; for they gained the Bridge, and forced him to retire; ſo they march on without impediment to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Lambert</hi> following them at the heels, and <hi>Cromwell</hi> with all poſſible expedition ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing from <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Militia in every County being raiſed, or marching towards them, to incloſe them in that City of which they had poſſeſſed themſelves.</p>
               <p>For on Friday the 23 of <hi>August,</hi> the King with his Army entred <hi>Worceſter,</hi> reſolving to tarry there and abide the brunt, for there were now ſo many Forces leavied, that all wayes were ſtopt to impead his Marching farther. He cauſes works to be raiſed here for his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſecurity, and ſends forth his Letters Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory to Collonel <hi>Mackworth,</hi> Governour of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> for leavying Forces to aſſiſt him; but both his commands and perſwaſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vain and unnſefull.</p>
               <p>And now the black day begins to draw nigh; <hi>Cromwell</hi> with an iuimaginable celerity joyns with <hi>Fleetwood, Desborough, Gray</hi> of <hi>Groby, Lambert,</hi> and <hi>Harriſon,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the reſt of the Parliaments Forces; the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170564:51"/>Militia Forces are likewiſe joyned to them; ſo they all march unanimouſly forward to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the Scotch Army in this pound at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi> Nor was there ever ſo great an Army gathered together in ſo ſmall a time in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for the whole force could not amount to leſs then 80000 men.</p>
               <p>The Army being now drawn near to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> the firſt deſign they ſet upon was the poſſeſſion of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> Bridge, where <hi>Cromwell</hi> intended to paſs over with his Army. <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> had the management of this enterprize, who ſends firſt a ſmall party of Horſe and Foot, to judge of the feaſableneſs of the attempt: theſe though they found the Bridge broken down, all ſave only one beam of Timber, which reached from one Arch to another, boldly diſmount and venture over, and ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Church, which <hi>Maſſey</hi> (who lay in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> with about 200 Horſe and 60 Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons in a great deal of ſecurity, not dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Enemy) allarmed at, aſſaults, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt in the mean time <hi>Lambert</hi> paſſes over a conſiderable party of Horſe to their relief; whereupon <hi>Maffey</hi> finding it in vain to fight, made an honourable retreat towards <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> himſelf ſtill bringing up the rear, in which ſervice he was wounded by a ſhot in the hand.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:170564:51"/>
               <p>The Bridge thus won is immediately repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> Army paſſes all over whileſt <hi>Cromwell</hi> cauſes a Bridge of Boats to be made over the Severn, on the other ſide, that by paſſing over his Army, the Enemy might be the more ſtreightened.</p>
               <p>But let us leave them a little at <hi>Worcester</hi> in the forementioned poſture, and look a little into <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> with about 300 Gentlemen, endeavour to raiſe the Country, and had a party of near 1500 Horſe and Foot; Collone <hi>Lilburne</hi> is ordered to oppoſe him, with whom Generall <hi>Cromwells</hi> Regiment of Foot is ordered to joyn. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their conjunction the Earl marches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> to ſurprize that Regiment; Collonel <hi>Lilburne</hi> flanks the Enemy in their march, hoping by that means to joyn with the Regiment; which to prevent, the Enemy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces him to engage; the diſpute was tedious, by reaſon <hi>Lilburne</hi> was over-matched with Foot, but in the end the Earl was totally rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Lord <hi>Widdrington,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170564:52"/>500 private Souldiers were taken, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Earl of <hi>Derbeys</hi> George, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and other Badges of his Order, but he himſelf eſcaped to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> there to tell the ſad news of his petty overthrow, which was but as a prologue to a greater.</p>
               <p>But to return again to <hi>Worceſter, Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> Army having all paſſed over <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> Bridge, make a Bridge of Boats over the River <hi>Teame,</hi> to attaque the Weſt ſide of the Town, which ſo alarmed the Scots, that they riſe from their Leaguer at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> and with a great part of their Horſe and Foot advance to oppoſe the Lieutenant Generals paſſage. The Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to divert their deſign leads on in perſon on the other ſide of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> which he had undertook to attaque, two Regiments of Foot, Collonel <hi>Hookers</hi> Horſe and his own Lifeguard, whileſt <hi>Fleetwood</hi> with Collonel <hi>Goffs</hi> and <hi>Deans</hi> Regiments of Foot, marches on to a Hedge-fight, which the Scots thought moſt ſecure, and ſtoutly maintained their ground, till the freſh ſupply of <hi>Blakes, Gibbons,</hi> and <hi>Marſhes</hi> Regiments force them to retire to <hi>Pawick</hi> Bridge, where they are again engaged by Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Hayns, Cobbets,</hi> and <hi>Matthews</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and at length ſtill overpowred by the Enemyes freſh ſupplyes, forced to retreat in ſome diſorderly haſt into <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:170564:52"/>
               <p>Their ſucceſs being ſo bad on this ſide againſt Lieutenant Generall <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> they reſolve to trie if they could have better fortune againſt <hi>Cromwell</hi> on the other ſide. Therefore on a ſuddain they ſally out with all the Horſe and Foot they could, and at the firſt ſhock made <hi>Cromwels</hi> men retire ſomewhat diſorderly, the King himſelf performing the duty of a valiant Commander in the head of his Horſe; but at length overpowred by their numerous freſh ſupplyes, they were put to the rout. The Horſe flying amain towards the North, and the Foot into <hi>Worcester,</hi> followed at the heels by their victors, who entred the Town with them, which they ſacked; killed, or took moſt of the Scots priſoners, who found life or death, according to the mercy of thoſe, into whoſe hands they fell.</p>
               <p>From this Battell there eſcaped only about 3000 Horſe, moſt or all the Infantry being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlain or taken, and near 100 priſoners of quality; of which the chief were, Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> (who fell now into Collonel <hi>Lilburnes</hi> hands, though he miſt him before) Earl of <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lauderdail,</hi> Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> Earl of <hi>Carnwath,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kelly,</hi> Lord <hi>Spine,</hi> Sir <hi>John Packington,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>Richard Fanſhaw,</hi> Secretary to his Majeſty. The number of the priſoners in the whole was given out to be near 10000, together with whom was taken the Kings Standard, Coach and Horſes, Collar of SS, and Star-Cloak. Major Generall <hi>Maſſey</hi> likewiſe though he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the Battell, yet not finding any ſecure ſhelter, and being grievouſly wounded, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred himſelf priſoner to the Counteſs of <hi>Stamford,</hi> and was ſecured by the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Groby</hi> her ſon, and after recovery of his wounds, by him ſent up to <hi>London,</hi> from whence he ſhortly after eſcaped.</p>
               <p>The News of this victory extreamly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs were ſomewhat ſorry for the eſcape of the King of Scots, who notwithſtanding the great ſearch made for him, and the Fine ſet upon his head, eſcaped. For after having quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the field at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he with only one ſervant with him retired into the Woods, where he hid himſelf two or three dayes, till at length coming to a Gentlemans houſe, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been a ſervant of his Fathers, he was by him conveyed to a noble Eſquires houſe in that County, where he lay diſguiſed near two Moneths, till the heat of the ſearch was over, from whence he came up to <hi>London</hi> as ſervant
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170564:53"/>to a Gentlewoman, and ſo at fit opportunity eſcaped into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many of the Scotch Nobility were about this time taken by Generall <hi>Monck</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at a place called <hi>Ellet,</hi> where they were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to negotiate the royall affairs; <hi>viz.</hi> old Generall <hi>Leſley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marſhall,</hi> Earl of <hi>Craford,</hi> Lord <hi>Keith,</hi> Lord <hi>Ogilby,</hi> Lord <hi>Bargayny,</hi> Lord <hi>Huntly,</hi> Lord <hi>Lee,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Knights, Gentlemen, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who were ſhortly after ſent by Sea to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> after his great victory at <hi>Worceſter</hi> on the third of <hi>September,</hi> (his ever propitious day) on the eighth ſets forward towards <hi>London,</hi> where arriving on the twelfth he was met by the Speaker, and moſt of the Members of Parliament, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the Counſell of State, the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> with great acclamations of joy, and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Parliaments obligation to him for his eminent ſervices, which was expreſſed by the Speaker in a very elegant ſpeech.</p>
               <p>Shortly after two of the Parliaments Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains left this world, both men of eminent conduct, the one Generall <hi>Popham,</hi> one of the Admirals of their Fleet, who was a man from whom all men expected excellent ſervice for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170564:54"/>them, had his dayes been prolonged: The other the Lord Deputy <hi>Ireton,</hi> who died of the plague under the Walls of <hi>Limerick,</hi> whoſe body (or a Coffin in its ſtead) was afterwards brought over into <hi>England,</hi> and laid in State in <hi>Sommerſet</hi>-Houſe, and from thence carried with as much pomp (as ever any Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſince the conqueſt) to be interred in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> Abbey, where his Effigies was likewiſe ſet up in requitall of his many ſervices, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long time been one of the Parliaments fortunate Commanders.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Parliament take order for the ſpeedy reducing of the Iſlands of <hi>Gerſey</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> in purſuance whereof Collonel <hi>Haynes</hi> with two Regiments of Foot and four Troops of Horſe, ſet ſail out of <hi>Weymouth</hi> the 16 of <hi>October,</hi> and arriving at <hi>Gerſey</hi> though they found ſome oppoſition at Landing, yet they eaſily forced their way, and ſoon poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves of the Iſland, all the Forts in it being preſently delivered to them, except <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> Caſtle, which held out till the middle of <hi>December,</hi> and was then ſurrendred upon Articles.</p>
               <p>Collonel <hi>Duckenfield,</hi> with his own Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Cromwels</hi> and Generall <hi>Deans</hi> Regiments of Foot and two Troops of Horſe, on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> departed out of the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Reaumor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:170564:54"/>towards the Iſland of <hi>Man,</hi> and arriving there on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in <hi>Ramſey-Bay,</hi> there came aboard to them an Iſlander, to aſſure them that they ſhould have no oppoſition in their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that they might come ſecurely under their Forts which they had taken poſſeſſion of for them; that only two Caſtles held out, <hi>viz. Peel</hi> and <hi>Ruſhen,</hi> which were held by the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Counteſs of <hi>Derby,</hi> which they would help them to reduce. He is at firſt diſtruſted, having nothing in writing to ſhow, but Major <hi>Fox</hi> being ſent aſhore, findes it true; ſo the Army lands and beſieges both the Caſtles of <hi>Peel</hi> and <hi>Ruſhen,</hi> which after ſhort time delivered up with bloud to Collonel <hi>Duckenfield</hi> for the uſe of the Parliament, on the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1651, where there was found good ſtore of proviſion and Ammunition of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>Shortly after was ſurrendred to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Forces the ſtrong and impregnable hold of <hi>Corne</hi>-Caſtle in the Iſle of <hi>Guernſey,</hi> with good conditions to the defendants, conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being had to the ſtrength of the place, and the bloud might probably be yet ſpent in reducing it <hi>per</hi> force, or the charge they muſt neceſſarily have been at in ſtarving it out, it being ſtill found very well victualled.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding that numerous company
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170564:55"/>of Noble men and Perſons of quality that were taken with the King at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> there were none ſuffered under the Axe of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Juſtice, but only the Earl of <hi>Derby;</hi> who notwithſtanding his having quarter given him for life, was by a Counſell of Warre condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death, and accordingly had his head ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from his body on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where he firſt began his riſing; and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Timothy Fetherſtone</hi> who was executed ſhortly after. Some other perſons of meaner quality ſuffered death at <hi>Cheſter, Shrewsbury,</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p>And now the Parliament having ſetled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo well at home, begin to take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the many wrongs, affronts and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs committed upon the Engliſh Nation by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> together with their delays in treating for an Accommodation: therefore to ſhew their reſentment, they put forth an Act for encouragement of Navigation, the moſt pleaſing to the Engliſh Marriners, and diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> that poſſible could be. The heads of it were theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That no Commodity whatſoever of the growth or manufacture of</hi> Europe, Aſia, Affrica <hi>or</hi> America, <hi>or any part thereof, as well of the Engliſh Plantations as others, ſhould be emport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into</hi> England, Ireland, <hi>or any of the Territories

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That no Commodities whatſoever of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign growth or manufacture which are to be brought into this Commonwealth, in Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the people thereof, ſhall be by them ſhipped from any places, but only from thoſe of the ſaid growth, production or manufacture, or from thoſe ports where the ſaid Commodities can only be or uſually have been ſhipt for transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from none other places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That no ſort of Fiſh uſually caught by the people of this Nation, nor any Oyl made of Fiſh, nor any Whale, Finne or Whalebones, ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported as aboveſaid, but only ſuch as ſhall be caught in Veſſels belonging to the people of this Nation, under the former penalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That no kinds of ſalted Fiſh from the firſt of</hi> February 1653, <hi>ſhall be exported out of this Land in any other ſave Engliſh Veſſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were ſeverall Exceptions and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoes in it in refference to the Commodities of <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> from the <hi>Levant</hi> ſeas, from the Ports of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Act extreamly perplexes the Hollander, who upon it they ſend over their extraordinary Ambaſſadours to renew a Treaty, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170564:56"/>by all means poſſible the calling in of that Act which would be ſo pernicious to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing Trade; but their deſigns failing in its recalling, they grow angry, and begin to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the unqueſtionable right of the Engliſh Soveraignty in the narrow Seas, refuſing to lore their top-ſails; which was the occaſion of that great breach of peace between theſe two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques, more potent in ſhipping then all the reſt of the Chriſtian world. The firſt bruſh hapned thus. In the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1652, <hi>Van-Trump</hi> Admirall of the Dutch-Fleet, with about 42 ſail of Ships was diſcovered on the back ſide of the <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſands, bearing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Dover</hi>-Road. Major <hi>Bourne</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a ſquadron of the Parliaments Ships lying then in the Downs, preſently ordered the Greyhound Frigat to make ſail and ſpeak with them: which ſhe did with the foremoſt, and they civilly ſtrook their topſails, and ſaid <hi>They came from Admirall</hi> Trump <hi>with a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Engliſh Admirall;</hi> and coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board our Ships, told our men <hi>That the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly winds having blown hard ſeverall dayes, they were forced further to the Southward then they intended, and having rode ſome days off</hi> Dunkirk, <hi>had loſt there divers Cables and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, profeſſing they intended no harm to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Nation.</hi> In the mean time Major <hi>Bourne</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:170564:56"/>having given Generall <hi>Blake</hi> who was to the Weſtward with the reſt of the Fleet, ſpeedy advice of them, he makes what haſte he can towards them, and on the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> in the morning he ſpies them at Anchor in <hi>Dover</hi>-Road; upon ſight of him they weigh and ſtand to the Eaſtward, where they met with an Expreſs from the States; whereupon they tacked about and bore directly for the Engliſh Fleet, <hi>Van-Trump</hi> being in the head with his Flag aloft and refuſing to ſtrike: Whereupon Generall <hi>Blake</hi> lets fly three Guns, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Balls, at <hi>Trumps</hi> Flag, and <hi>Trump</hi> in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain ſhot off a Gun to the windward, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of loring his Flag, hangs out a red one of defiance (as a ſign to his whole Fleet to begin the fight,) and gave Generall <hi>Blake</hi> a broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; which was anſwered immediately with another, ſo the fight began hotly on both ſides, and continued about four hours till night part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. There was one Dutch Ship ſunk, and another of thirty Guns taken with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of both and neer 150 Priſoners: of the Engliſh there was about 10 killed and 40 wounded: ſome Ships, and eſpecially the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, dammaged in their maſts, ſails and rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, but no conſiderable hurt done.</p>
               <p>This attempt of the Dutch upon the Engliſh Fleet, whileſt their Ambaſſadours were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170564:57"/>for Peace, ſo incenſed the Parliament, that notwithſtanding all that poſſibly could be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, either by thoſe two Ambaſſadours then in <hi>England,</hi> or two other ſent over, could not appeaſe them, but they were fully reſolved to be revenged of the Hollander for this high and daring affront; which finall anſwer their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours having received, had leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
               <p>And now theſe two mighty Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, prepare with all vigour poſſible for warre. Generall <hi>Blake</hi> with a gallant Fleet of Ships is ſent Northward toward the Iſles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> to ſeize upon all ſuch as he ſhould find fiſhing on thoſe Coaſts, where he took 12 Dutch men of Warre which were Convoyers to thoſe Fiſhermen.</p>

                  <hi>George Ayſkew</hi> with his ſquadron of Ships left to guard the narrow Seas, makes prize of many <hi>Holland</hi> Merchantmen, and going to <hi>Plimouth</hi> to clear the Seas and convoy thoſe Engliſh Merchantmen that lay there, to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> being about 8, or 10 leagues off <hi>Plimouth,</hi> he receives intelligence of the Dutch Fleet, calls a Counſell of Warre, and reſolves to find them out; and the ſame day being the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> between one and two in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, they had ſight of the Dutch Fleet, and preſently ſtood towards them with all the ſayl

                  <hi>George</hi> with a ſquadron of ſeaven Ships charges through and through the Dutch, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they at firſt brunt received very much dammage in their maſts and rigging; and had the reſt of the Captains done their duty, they had in all probability routed the Dutchmens great Fleet, but at length the night parted them: the Engliſh in this fight had ſeverall Captains wounded, and Captain <hi>Pack</hi> killed.</p>
               <p>Prizes of <hi>Holland</hi> Merchant-men are daily ſent into the River by Generall <hi>Blake,</hi> Vice-Admirall <hi>Pen,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Askew,</hi> to the great encouragement of Engliſh Marriners, thoſe Merchants Ships having generally good plunder, and being taken with little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>And now a Fleet of <hi>French</hi> fals likewiſe into the hands of the Engliiſh, which as they were going to relieve <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> are ſpied by the Engliſh, and being purſued, are moſt of them taken. The names of them were, The <hi>Triton</hi> with 31 Guns, the <hi>Shepheard</hi> 29 Guns, the <hi>Gift of God</hi> 30 Guns, the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> 22 Guns, the <hi>Creſcent</hi> 26 Guns, the <hi>Hunter</hi> 22 Guns, the S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> 28 Guns, a ſmall Frigot of 8 Guns, and 6 Fire-ſhips. The taking of this Fleet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the French in <hi>Dunkirke</hi> deſpair of relief,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170564:58"/>cauſed the rendition both of it and <hi>Graveling,</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now on the 28 of <hi>September</hi> happened that notable fight between the Engliſh and Dutch, commonly called the <hi>Kentiſh Knock.</hi> Generall <hi>Blake</hi> having diſcovered a Fleet of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> conſiſting of about ſixty Sail (on the backſide of the <hi>Goodwin Sands</hi>) under the Command of Admirall <hi>Dewit,</hi> makes towards them, and engages them; but the Dutch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed themſelves under the Sand called the <hi>Kentiſh Knock,</hi> to hinder the Engliſh from coming to the <hi>Weathergage,</hi> they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do it had like to have endammaged themſelves: for the <hi>Admirall,</hi> the <hi>Royall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,</hi> the <hi>Reſolution,</hi> and the S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Andrew,</hi> and others ſtruck on the Sands, but getting off again without any harm, fell afreſh to the work, till night parted them. Next Morning <hi>September</hi> 29 the Duch Fleet was ſeen two Leagues Northeaſt off the Engliſh, who made after them all the forenoon with that little wind there was, but the wind coming to North and by Weſt, they could not get up to them; yet ſome of the beſt Frigots were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bear as near the Dutch as they could, and keep them in play till the reſt came up. About three a Clock they got within ſhot of the Dutch Fleet, who fearing that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170564:58"/>the Engliſh would get within them, ſet up their main Sails and ran for it, whom ten Frigots had in chaſe till ſix a Clock; the next day the whole Fleet purſued the Dutch into their very harbours. In this ſight the Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had five Ships diſabled, among which the Rearadmirall was one, whoſe Captain and men the Engliſh took out of her, but left her floating on the ſea. The Engliſh loſt not above forty men.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time the Hollanders get the better of a ſquadron of our Ships in the <hi>Straits,</hi> where they were eleven to four, they take the <hi>Phaenix,</hi> an Engliſh Ship of 45 Guns, which the Engliſh retake afterwards by a ſtratagem.</p>
               <p>The Daniſh Ambaſſadour who was come over juſt at the beginning of the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Commonwealths, the wound now beginning to feſter, is recalled by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; who was forc't to temporize with the Hollanders, and who to that effect detains 22 Engliſh Merchants Ships which were coming from the <hi>Eaſtland;</hi> and notwithſtanding all fair treaties, would not be perſwaded to let the Ships go, but took out the Goods and ſold them.</p>
               <p>The Hollanders now prepare to be revenged of thoſe rubs they had received from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and to that intent appear on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170564:59"/>
                  <hi>December</hi> on the backſide of the <hi>Goodwin</hi> with 90 Men of Warre and 10 Fireſhips; the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh were 42 ſail in the <hi>Downs,</hi> yet for all their ſmall number reſolve to fight them, though it proved to their loſs; for the <hi>Garland</hi> and <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure</hi> beſides two Merchants Ships were taken, Generall <hi>Blake</hi> himſelf was endangered, and the <hi>Vanguard</hi> and <hi>Victory</hi> ſcarce got off clear. This loſs made Generall <hi>Blake</hi> retreat into <hi>Lee</hi> Road, ſo that the Dutch bragg'd of us (as we before had done of them,) that they had purſued us unto our Harbours.</p>
               <p>The Parliament however provide to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge this loſs, and to that effect order fit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Marriners; <hi>That their pay inſtead of</hi> 18<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, <hi>ſhould be</hi> 23<hi rend="sup">s</hi> per menſem. <hi>That for every Prize they ſhall take, they have</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 
                  <hi>for every Tunburthen, and</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 13<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>for every Piece of Ordinance, to be equally distributed, beſides the rifling of all above the Gun deck. That they ſhall have</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
                  <hi>a Gun for every Man of Warre they ſhall ſink or deſtroy by fire,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That they which will come in to ſerve volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſhall have a moneths pay gratis.</hi> Care was likewiſe taken for Proviſions for ſick and wounded men aboard and Maintenance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore.</p>
               <p>Theſe encouragements made the Seamen ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more willingly, ſo that about the middle
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170564:59"/>of <hi>February</hi> the Engliſh had a gallant Fleet of Ships at Sea, which the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day diſcovered the Dutch Fleet, in number about 80 Men of War, with about 150 Merchant men from <hi>Roan, Nants</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> between <hi>Portland</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi> About eight in the morning, Generall <hi>Blake</hi> and Generall <hi>Deane</hi> in the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,</hi> with three or four of the headmoſt Ships of the Engliſh Fleet, endured the brunt with neer 30 of the Dutch men of Warre till two or three of the Clock, when half the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Fleet came up, who continued the fight till night. The Engliſh in this days ſervice had the <hi>Sampſon</hi> (a Flemiſh Prize) diſabled, the Men they afterwards took out and ſunk the Ship themſelves; the Dutch had one Ship ſunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 19. The Dutch ſteering on their courſe, the Engliſh made towards them, brought ſome of their Ships by the Lee and deſtroyed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 20. The two Fleets engaged, and the diſpute continued very hot for near five or ſix hours, till at laſt the Dutch begun to fire out of their ſternmoſt Ports, and fly away; ſo the Engliſh gave them a chaſe, took fifty of their Merchants, and nine men of War. The ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was great on both ſides, though greater on the Dutch then Engliſh.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the Dutch are thus beaten in the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170564:60"/>Channell, they give us a blow before the Port of <hi>Livorne,</hi> where the <hi>Leopard, Peregrine,</hi> and <hi>Levant Merchant</hi> are taken by them, the <hi>Sampſon</hi> fired, and the <hi>Bonadventure</hi> blown up; Captain <hi>Badiley</hi> who lay out at Sea du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this fight with twelve Ships, not being able or willing to come to their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>In the mean time arrives an extraordinary Ambaſſadour from the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> to the Parliament, which after many addreſſes, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and conferences is concluded, upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to ſatisfie the Engliſh Merchants loſſes.</p>
               <p>From <hi>France</hi> there comes two Agents, one from the King of <hi>France,</hi> deſired releaſe of thoſe Ships taken before <hi>Dunkirke;</hi> as alſo that there might be a right underſtanding between the two Nations. The other from the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> craving aid againſt the Cardinall and his faction, who had ſtrongly beſieged <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux;</hi> but they both proved ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <p>And now happened a very ſtrange alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Scene of affairs in <hi>England. Cromwell</hi> whoſe ambition was now ripe, and who knew that now he might take a very fit opportunity to uſurp that power he had ſo long gaped for; the people of theſe Nations being weary of the actions of this Parliament, and their dilatory
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170564:60"/>proceedings and apparent intentions of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating themſelves; and he perceiving that as the people were weary of them, ſo they would be would be willing to be rid of them: On the 20 of <hi>April</hi> 1653. enters the Parliament houſe, attended by ſome of his principall Officers, where he delivered ſeverall reaſons why that Parliament ſhould be diſſolved, and a period put to its ſitting, which was immediately done. The Speaker with the reſt of the Members, (ſome by force, ſome through fear, and ſome through murmuring) departing the houſe, all the Nation rejoycing, and ſcarce a man grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for their diſſolution, but themſelves; it being generally believed, that though the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might not be bettered by this change, yet worſe could not befall it.</p>
               <p>But to ſatisfie the wiſer ſort of people, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Counſell of Officers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a very large and ſpecious Declaration, ſhewing the reaſons of his diſſolving this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; <hi>in that they regarded not the Nations good, or proceeded to the eſtabliſhment of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth as they pretended, but only to an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary perpetuation of their power; and that therefore ſome other meanes muſt be ſought for the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a Government, as might ſuit with the Liberties and Priviledges of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:170564:61"/>
               <p>Thus that part of the Parliament who had cut off their King and Maſters head; and uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an authority over theſe Nations, is turned out of doors by their ſervant <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and their power wholly taken into his own hands; which how he executed and improved to his own advantage, in the next part ſhall be declared.</p>

               <p>The Dutch (however the Engliſh Nation ſeemed generally ſatisfied) yet hoped that ſuch diſtractions might advance their cauſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ariſing from this ſuddain alteration and change of the State of affairs in <hi>England</hi> (ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining Chimeraes in fancies, and building Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the Air, with vain hopes that theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions at Land, would hinder all preparations at Sea to oppoſe them; ſo having manned out a high and mighty Fleet, they begun to play the <hi>Rex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt having ready in their habours, a numerous Fleet of Merchant-men, bound for <hi>France, Spain, Italy,</hi> the <hi>Levant,</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> they with a Fleet of 90 Sail of men of War, undertake to convoy and ſecure them from all Engliſh ſurprizals; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their force, they dare not venture to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them through <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Georges</hi> Channell, his Croſs having ſo oft proved bloudy to them there, but chuſe rather to ſteer their courſe round the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which way though it was far more long and tedious, yet was as much more ſafe and ſecure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trump</hi> having happily according to his Commiſſion left theſe Merchant-men out of all ſuſpicion of danger, tacks about, and bends
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170564:63"/>his courſe to the <hi>Sound,</hi> from whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys home a great Fleet of <hi>Eaſtland</hi>-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-men, from <hi>Ruſſia, Denmarke, Dantzicke,</hi> and other Ports of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Ocean; and in his voyage he meets with another Fleet of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> coming from <hi>France,</hi> which being joyned to him, he enters with a great deal of bravery into the Ports of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> his Fleet in the whole conſiſting of between 3 and 400 Sail of Ships.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Flemmings</hi> pufft up with this happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and underſtanding that the Engliſh Fleet was gone Northward, thought to do ſome noble exploit on the Engliſh in their abſence. Having therefore hoiſed Sail, they ſtand over for the <hi>Downs;</hi> and on the 25 of <hi>May</hi> ranged themſelves in <hi>Douer</hi>-Road with 108 Ships, where finding but three ſmall Ships, (a poor prize for ſo great a Navy) they began to wreak their malice upon the Town, by beating ſome Tiles off from the tops of the houſes with their great Shot, wherein they manifeſted far more folly then valour.</p>
               <p>From thence they ſtood off towards the North, out of a pretence to ſeek for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Fleet, which they boaſted they muſt ſend Hue and Cry after, but they met them ſooner then they expected; for the Engliſh Fleet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned Southwards, and Anchoring

               <p>This firſt dayes diſpute was very hot on both ſides, and ſo continued till night parted them, though little harm was done to the Engliſh, but only the loſs of Generall <hi>Dean,</hi> who was ſlain in the beginning of the encounter, with a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhot from one of the enemies Rear-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, as it was ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day though it were late before the Fleets could joyn, yet the diſpute proved very hot and bloudy. <hi>Van Trump</hi> had at firſt got the advantage of that little wind was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and brought up his Fleet in very good order, thinking to charge through and through the Engliſh, but his deſign failed; for the wind rearing about to the Weſterly, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Generals <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Moncke,</hi> fell in ſo furiouſly amongſt the thickeſt of the Dutch Fleet, that they ſoon forced them to retire;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170564:64"/>and their thundrings of Shot ſtill continuing, the Dutch not able to abide it, tacked about, and with all the Sail they could make, ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own Coaſts. But the Engliſh in reſpect of thoſe dangerous flats, thought it not ſafe to purſue them too far, but only ſent ſome light Frigots to diſcover their courſe.</p>
               <p>In this encounter there was no certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count could be given of the Dutch that were ſlain; but there were taken priſoners 6 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; 1350 common-Seamen and others; 11 men of War taken; 6 ſunk. Of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, Gnerall <hi>Dean</hi> ſlain; 1 Captain killed; 120 Sea-men ſlain; and 236 wounded: But in all this deſperate Batrell not one Ship loſt or diſabled.</p>
               <p>The Dutch Fleet by the opportunity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the night, got into the <hi>Wielings;</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ley,</hi> and the <hi>Texell,</hi> to recruit their men, and repair their loſſes which were ſo great; but the loſs on the Engliſh ſide being ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, they reſolved to keep the Sea, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mended their torn and tottered rigging, they call a Counſell of War, where it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, that the whole: Fleet ſhould make what haſt they could towards the <hi>Weilings,</hi> and by ranging up and down the Coaſt, block up the Dutch in their habours, which they did for a good ſpace of time, taking prizes at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170564:64"/>and not permitting the Dutch whoſe Fleet was ſeperated into ſeverall harbours, to joyn or be in a capacity to make any reſiſtance; ſo that the Dutch (having now the Engliſh Fleet conſtantly in ſight, though againſt their wils) need not be put to any further trouble of making a Hue and Cry after them. But let us leave the Hollanders thus blockt up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our Scepter-aſpiring <hi>Cromwell</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who having finiſhed his Conſultations with his Counſell of Officers, about chooſing thoſe perſons into whoſe hands he intended to put the Legiſlative power of the Nation, ſends out his Warrants to thoſe perſons (ſo by him cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen) (whom he will have ſtiled a Parliament, though they amounted not to above 140 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the three Nations) to appear at the Counſell-Chamber in <hi>Whitehall</hi> on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1653. where they being accordingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> attended by ſeverall Officers of the Army, makes them a ſhort ſpeech, which being ended, he delivers them a Writing under his hand and Seal, impowring them to be the ſupreme legiſlative Authority of the three Nations of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with all the Territories thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing; and that any forty of them ſhould be a Quorum ſufficient to diſpatch any publick
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170564:65"/>buſineſs, make Laws, raiſe Moneys, and order the affairs of Peace and War as they ſhould think fit; only their ſitting was limited to the third of <hi>Nouember</hi> 1654, and three Moneths before their diſſolution, they were to make choiſe of others to ſucceed in their room. So <hi>Cromwell</hi> having canted out a prayer that God would bleſs them and their Counſels, diſmiſſed them.</p>
               <p>From thence they retired to the old Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-houſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where having choſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Rouſe</hi> Speaker, they began to debate what they ſhould call themſelves, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſomething elſe; but at laſt it was reſolved in the affirmative (by what law or reaſon few cangueſs) that all addreſſes ſhould be made to them as to a Parliament.</p>
               <p>But it is very like many (if not moſt) of this pact Parliament knew very well for what end and purpoſe they were called, <hi>viz.</hi> to make way for <hi>Cromwels</hi> future greatneſs; and though perhaps theſe were the fewer part, yet be plainly endeavoured to hedge in the greater by ſomenting thoſe differences among them, which his earneſt preſſing them to take the Tithes and Univerſities into conſideration, cauſed.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> who for his factious ſpirit had long lain in priſon, and was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170564:65"/>at laſt baniſhed by the long Parliament, upon occaſion of this change of Government, came into <hi>England,</hi> and caſt himſelf upon the Lord Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> for protection; but he knowing his turbulent temper, refuſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle, but left him to the Law, ſo being committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> he was brought to his triall in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> where notwithſtanding the endeavours of his adverſaries, he ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaded his cauſe, that the Jury brought him in not guilty. But however his ſpirit be very well known, and that he would ſtill be carping at whatever Government ſhould be eſtabliſhed, he was ſtill kept priſoner firſt in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and after in <hi>Dover</hi>-Caſtle, where <hi>Trandling</hi> according to the madneſs of his brain, from one opinion to another he at length fell into Quakeriſme, in which hereſie he died.</p>
               <p>But let us look a little into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where though the Engliſh had got poſſeſſion of moſt of the Forts, Garriſons, and ſtrong holds, in the Low-lands, yet the High-landers from their craggy Cliffs made many incurſions into the Country, committing many Murthers, Robberies, and Outrages upon both people and Souldiers; forth with again betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their inacceſſible faſtneſſes, whither our Souldiers not knowing the Country nor
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170564:66"/>Paſſes, could not tell how to purſued them, and they encreaſing daily into great numbers, headed by <hi>Glencarne, Atholl, Seafort,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Lord <hi>Seafort</hi> having ſurprized ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight men, that came aſhore to ſeek proviſions from aboard the <hi>Fortune</hi> Frigot, who layar Anchor at <hi>Lew is</hi> Iſland, was ſo vain as to ſend his Summons to the Ship, requiring it to ſurrender, but it proved as could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe expected, ineffectuall.</p>
               <p>The condition of <hi>Ireland</hi> was the ſame with that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> all the ſtrong holds and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes being reduced to the Engliſh yoke, nor any oppoſition made, but what the excurſions of ſome Tories (who lurked in Woods and Faſtneſſes, and did much damage to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people and travellers on the Road) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>The Hollanders perceiving their force too weak to reſiſt the Engliſh ſtrength, ſend over four Commiſſioners, <hi>viz. Monſieur Beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Newport, Youngſtall,</hi> and <hi>Vanderpaue,</hi> (who died ſoon aftet his arrivall here) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new again the Treaty. Though three remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commiſſioners purſued their negotiations very cloſe, yet the Treaty produced at that preſent neither ceſſation or intermiſſion of Arms, but both parties prepared for War, and had during the Treaty a moſt remarkable Fight, which happened thus.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:170564:66"/>
               <p>On the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> the Engliſh Scouts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a Dutch Fleet from the <hi>Weilings,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of about 95 men of War, (which Fleet <hi>Van Trump</hi> had all that while been preparing with indefatigable labour to beat the Engliſh from his Countries harbours; and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and add reſolution to his Seamen, had made proclamation, That all the men of War taken from the Engliſh ſhould be the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with a conſiderable Summe of Money to whomever ſhould take the Admirals or vice-Admirals Flag. The Engliſh Scouts having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied them gave notice to the Fleet, who made what Sail they could poſſibly towards them, which the Dutch diſcerning, ſtood away, and the Engliſh after them, but the wind being ſcarce, came not into Shot till ſix a Clock, when thirty light Frigots engaged them, but little was done this day, in regard the night parted them.</p>
               <p>The Dutch all night ſtood into the <hi>Texell,</hi> where there joyned with them 25 ſtout men of War more, ſo that now they made 120 in all. With this Fleet <hi>Van Trump</hi> the next morning by break of day faced the Engliſh Fleet: But the Generals <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Moncke,</hi> finding the wind ſomewhat high and the weather thick and cloudy, fearing the Sands or a Lee ſhore more then all the Dutch force, ſtood off to Sea, which
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170564:67"/>made the Dutch ſuppoſe a flight; ſo that one of <hi>Trumps</hi> Captains urged him to purſue them, telling him, <hi>that thoſe dogs durſt not abide one broad ſide from his Excellency; that he might clearly ſee they ran away for fear, and that he ſhould not loſe ſo fair an opportunity.</hi> But ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Van Trump</hi> who knew the Engliſh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, returned the Captain this modeſt anſwer: <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> be you carefull to look to your charge, and trouble your head no further, for if the Engliſh were but</hi> 10 <hi>Sail, I am ſure they would fight us,</hi> and ſo indeed it happened; for the weather clearing up, and the wind laying, they drew up their Fleet into a body, and tacked about to meet the Enemy, who being likewiſe in a poſture, they preſently engaged. The Fight was couragiouſly maintained on both ſides, from between five and ſix in the morning, till one in the afternoon, both Fleets charging va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly one through the other; till at length (the Dutch Admirall <hi>Van Trump,</hi> fighting in the midſt of the Engliſh Fleet with a great deal of courage and reſolution, was by a Musket Bullet ſhot on the left Pap near the heart, and ſlain outright.) The Dutch began to decline, many of their Ships being likewiſe fired or ſunk; and the amazement for their Generals death poſſeſſing the whole Navy, they hoiſed up all the Sail poſſibly they could, and made away
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170564:67"/>directly for the <hi>Texell;</hi> and the Engliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides the damage many of their Ships had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, were loath to be too hold on that ſhore, ſo they purſued them no farther, but ſteered their courſe to <hi>Soal buy,</hi> that they might there diſpoſe of the priſoners, and mend their totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sails and Rigging.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh in this Fight had 8 Captains ſlain outright, <hi>viz. Graves, Chapvian, Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Newman, Crispe, Owen, Cox,</hi> and <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock;</hi> and 400 common Seamen; they had likewiſe 700 men wounded, of which 5 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, <hi>viz. Stoakes, Seaman, Rouſe, Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and <hi>Cabit;</hi> they loſt but one Ship, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Oake</hi> which was burnt by a Fireſhip, and had two or three more diſabled. As for the loſs the Dutch received, in relation to thoſe ſlain or wounded, was uncertain; but their viſible loſs was 30 men of War ſunk or fired, 6 Captains, and about a 1000 priſoners taken; but their greateſt loſs and indeed the loſs of all was the loſs of their Renowned Generall <hi>Van Trump,</hi> who had the hard fortune to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beaten by the Engliſh; yet could not his judgement be at all taxed, nor his fame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed, which formerly he had ſo deſervedly gotten, to be eſteemed one of the ableſt and beſt underſtanding Sea-Captains in the world.</p>
               <p>For this ominent piece of Service, <hi>Cromwels</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:170564:68"/>pact Parliament ordered that Chains of gold ſhould be preſented to the Admirals <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Moncke,</hi> Vice-Admirall <hi>Pen,</hi> and Rear-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall <hi>Lawſon;</hi> other Chains were likewiſe preſented to other Flag-Captains; and Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of ſilver to the Officers of the Fleet, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their good ſervice.</p>
               <p>But whileſt our Fleets are thus victorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, diſcontents are broached at home, by reaſon the Parliament had now ſat near ſix Moneths, and effected nothing for the good and ſettlement of the Nation; having indeed done nothing at all but made that Act concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Marriages, out of meer envy and deſpite to the Clergy.</hi> So beginning at firſt to lop off a branch of the <hi>Miniſters maintenance,</hi> that they might afterwards cut down the Tree. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Tithes</hi> it is debated in the Houſe what saw fit to be done, and a Committee appointed to onſider of ſo weighty a buſineſs, who being fully convinced in a full hearing by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and reaſons drawn both from the Laws of God and man, of the legality of it, make report to the Houſe in the affirmative for <hi>Tithes;</hi> which ſo exaſperated thoſe who were of the contrary faction, that they begin clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to argue againſt the <hi>Miniſteriall Function,</hi> urging it to be burdenſome to the people, and by that ſtrange conſequence <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:170564:68"/>There were near 60 of the Members of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which the reſt (though the major part, fearing would undermine them, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of ſome opportunity to aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, and by any forty of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Quorum, accompliſh their deſignes) reſolve to diſſolve their Houſe themſelves; which motion being made by a Member on the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> was readily aſſented to, and ſo the Speaker and ſeverall others adjourned to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and redelivered their Inſtrument of Government into the hands of <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> from whom they had received it.</p>
               <p>This Parliament having thus by writings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their hands reſigned again the power given them, the whole Authority both Civill and Military of theſe three Nations, was by this reſignation ſtrangely underſtood to be devolved into the hands of <hi>Oliver Cromwell.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he calls a Counſell of Officers, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome others joyned with them to conſult of the ſettlement of a Government, at length after much ſeeking of God (where I leave the Reader to judge of the rabble of hypocriticall canting that was blabbered out) they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have a <hi>Commonwealth in a ſingle Perſon:</hi> That that Perſon ſhould be <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> Captain Generall of all the Forces in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> That his Title ſhould

                  <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> now made Lord Protector, who had taken ſo many Oaths and Covenants before, is to ſwear afreſh, which was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1653 with a great deal of State, in the Chancery-Court in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>-Hall, before the Judges, Mayor, and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> with the chief Officers of the Natron, where in <hi>the preſence of God he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed upon Oath, not to violate or infringe the matters and things contained in the aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Inſtrument, but to obſerve and cauſe the ſame to be obſerved, and in all things to the best of his underſtanding, govern the Nations according to the Laws, Statutes, and Cuſtomes, ſeeking peace, cauſing juſtice and Law to be equally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Preſently after the Adminiſtration of this Oath, the following Proclamation was by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Counſell, publiſhed throughout all the Territories and Dominions of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereas the late Parliament diſſolved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and reſigning their whole powers and Authorities, the Government of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>by
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170564:70"/>a Lord Protector and ſucceſſive trienniall Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is now eſtabliſhed. And whereas</hi> Oliver Cromwell <hi>Captain Generall of all the Forces of this Commonwealth, is declared Lord Protector of the ſaid Nations, and hath accepted thereof, We have therefore thought it neceſſary (as we do hereby) to make publication of the premiſſes, and ſtrictly to charge and command all and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and perſons, of what quality and condition ſoever in any of the ſaid three Nations, to take notice hereof, and to conforme and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Government ſo eſtabliſhed. And all</hi> Sheriffs, Mayors, Bayliffs, <hi>&amp;c. are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to publiſh this Proclamation, to the end none may have cauſe to pretend ignorance in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Proclamation was firſt of all proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Serjeant at Arms in the Pallaceyard <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and by the Lord Major, Sheriffs and Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> at the Royall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and afterwards throughout all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> to ſhew their willing concurrence to this great Change, invite the Protector to a Dinner at <hi>Grocers</hi>-Hall, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is attended with a great deal of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, and received with as much pomp and ſplendor as poſſibly could be. There he firſt firſt makes uſe of the Power given him, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170564:70"/>Titles of Honour, by dubbing of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Thomas Viner</hi> then Lord Major of <hi>London</hi> Knight.</p>
               <p>And now out of imaginary fears of danger, the better to ſecure his ſtate, a ſeeming Plot is found out, ſome Cavaliers are ſent to the Tower, and the others warned from <hi>London</hi> upon it; but the Protector to ſhew his clemency at his firſt entrance into the Government, after ſome ſmall time of durance, releaſes again thoſe who were impriſoned in the Tower.</p>
               <p>The King of Scots being now come into <hi>France,</hi> was there honourably received by the Court where he took up his reſidence, at which time there were many diſcontents of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the blood, againſt the aſpiring ambition of Cardinall <hi>Mazarine,</hi> in ſo much that it had like to have come to a civill warre. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe which difference, the King of Scots offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mediate in order to a reconciliation, wherein he ſo farre prevailed, that he procured a Conference between Deputies on both ſides; to whom, although he urged his own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as an argument for the French King to compoſe the difference in love rather then to to ſtand it out; all which proving ineffectuall, both ſides betake themſelves to armes; the Treaty not ſucceeding; cauſed him to lie under the diſpleaſure of the Cardinall.</p>
               <p>The Scots in the <hi>Highlands</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170564:71"/>of <hi>Glencarne</hi> and <hi>Kenmore,</hi> by Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the King, rally and riſe to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable body of neer 4000 Horſe and Foot, hoping they might once more fairly diſpute their quarcell in field; but Major Generall <hi>Morgan</hi> with 1500 Horſe and Foot coming upon them at their Rendeſvouz, before they could get into any good order, killed neer 200 on the place, took moſt of the reſt Priſoners, <hi>Glencarne</hi> himſelf hardly eſcaping with about 40 Horſe.</p>
               <p>The three Agents from <hi>Holland</hi> having been here all this while, and little or nothing agre on for the ratification of a Peace between the two States, two of them went over to receive fuller power from the Lords States (as was pretended) but it was rather ſuſpected that it was to fetch Money, which was the only bait by which the Protector could be won to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, for at their return the Peace was ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clapt up, and by a large Proclamation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Articles (ſhewing the reaſon's of the Peace, which would ſo much (as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) redound to the good of the Nation, though no underſtanding Engliſhman but might gueſſe at the inconveniencies of it) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Aprill</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and after in other parts of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now another Plot ſucceeds the laſt, the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170564:71"/>chief deſigners are pretended to be <hi>Gilbert</hi> and <hi>John Gerrard</hi> Eſquires brothers, one <hi>Jones</hi> an Apotheeary, <hi>Tewdor, Fox</hi> and <hi>Vowell;</hi> the deſign was to have ſlain the Protector, raiſed an Army, and brought in the King; but how no man ever knew, (however theſe feigned Plots, or at leaſt Plots firſt contrived by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are good ſeturers of Tyrants and uſurpers; for hereby they fright men from reall deſignments,) the plotters are ſent to the Tower, and a High Court of Juſtice is erected for their triall, <hi>Gerrard</hi> and <hi>Vowell</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be hanged, the reſt are ſaved; <hi>Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> according to ſentence was hanged at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringcroſs,</hi> but Coll. <hi>Gerrard</hi> upon Petition had the favour to be beheaded at <hi>Towerhill,</hi> where he behaved himſelf ſo gallantly, and looked death ſo unappalledly in the face, that his very enemies were forced to admire his courage and conſtancy.</p>
               <p>At the very ſame time <hi>Don Pantaleon Sa</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Lord Ambaſſador of <hi>Portugall,</hi> was beheaded on the ſame ſcaffold, for having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a ridiculous Riot on the <hi>New Exchange,</hi> where (followed by a crew of mad fellowes, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Lacquies to his Brother or himſelf) he ſhot a Gentleman that was there walking, in the head, and had done further miſchief, had not the noble Coll. <hi>Gerrard</hi> (who was for
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170564:72"/>an other cauſe beheaded before him) ſtopt their fury, and with his Rapier drove them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him down ſtairs: This <hi>Portugall</hi> came with ſo great fear to the block, that many deemed his life was gone before the blow with the Axe was given.</p>
               <p>The King of Scots being ſtill in <hi>France,</hi> and finding notwithſtanding his own and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers endeavours, that the Treaty with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> was vigorouſly ſolicited by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Newfvill:</hi> Seeing that by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the Peace being concluded, he and his party muſt be enforced to leave <hi>France,</hi> thought it a great deal better and more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, voluntarily to deſert that Kingdom, then to ſtay till he were forced out by complement: ſo he with his Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> his Couſins Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> retired themſelves to <hi>Chatillon</hi> a houſe of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s, from whence not long after the King and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> went into <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now <hi>Glencarne</hi> reenforced by hopes of <hi>Middletons</hi> coming out of <hi>Holland</hi> with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Money and Ammunition, begins to ſtirre again in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> exhorting his Countrymen to gain themſelves immortall fame, by redeeming themſelves and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity from the ſlavery and bondage they now lay under, filling their ears with thoſe vaſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170564:72"/>ſupplies which <hi>Middleton</hi> was to bring out of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> At length <hi>Middleton</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives, and amongſt other things brings a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for himſelf to be Commander in Chief, and <hi>Monroe</hi> Lieutenant Generall. But <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne</hi> looks upon this as a very high affront, that he ſhould take the pains to raiſe an Army, and others be appointed to command over it; that he was a Souldier, and equally fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with the beſt, and therefore could not comport this affront done to his honour. <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton</hi> endeavours to reconcile theſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in vain, <hi>Clencarne</hi> diſdaining to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend lower then to be Lieutenant Generall, which neither <hi>Middleton</hi> nor <hi>Monroe</hi> would yeeld to; whereupon <hi>Glencarne</hi> challengeth his adverſary to a ſingle Duell, where Fortune favouring him, he wounds and diſarms <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe,</hi> and preſently after with neer 506 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men deſerts <hi>Middleton,</hi> and makes his compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with the Governour of <hi>Dunbarton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However <hi>Middleton</hi> proſecutes his deſignes as well as he can; Generall <hi>Monk</hi> is ſent againſt him, with Commiſſion to be Generall of the Forces in <hi>Scotland;</hi> he hearing of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, delayes marching towards them till he ſee the event, which happening as before, he advances towards <hi>Middleton,</hi> engages him at <hi>Loughgerry,</hi> Routs him and forces this ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170564:73"/>Generall to fly back again into <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I cannot omit a paſſage which may ſufficiently vindicate the Kings Majeſty of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from thoſe aſperſions of Popery laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. After the Kings departure out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> the young Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> was placed by the Queen-Mother in a Jeſuites Colledge, to be inſtructed in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Religion, which his Brother the King hearing of, ſent ſpeedy order to have him brought to him; which being obeyed, as he was departing <hi>Paris</hi> with the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Queen deſired only that he would ſtay and take a dinner in the Colledge before he went; to which he anſwered, <hi>That though ſhe were his Mother, yet he ought rather to give obedience to his Brother who was his King.</hi> This deniall ſo angred the Queen, that ſhe permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him not to take leave of her; and after when the King ſent a Letter to excuſe the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe in fvry burnt it; which circumſtances may ſufficiently evidence, that the King is ſtill truly Proteſtant.</p>
               <p>In the mean time our new Lord Protector, according to his Oath taken in the Inſtrument for Government, ſummons his Parliament on the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1654, which being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the day before their Seſſions, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor meets them in the <hi>Painted Chamber;</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:170564:73"/>where he only deſires them to accompany him to hear a Sermon in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby, and that afterwards he would impart his ſenſe to them. About nine of the Clock his Highneſs went from <hi>Whitehall</hi> to the <hi>Abby,</hi> attended by his ordinary Guard and ſome of his Counſell bare, the Lords Commiſſioners of the Great Seal and of the Treaſury, following in their Coaches, he going likewiſe in his Coach ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by <hi>Lambert</hi> and his Sonne <hi>Henry;</hi> here they ſtaid whileſt D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Goodwin</hi> finiſhed his Sermon, after which retiring into the Painted Chamber, he was followed by the Parliament, to whom he made a formall Speech much to this effect;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That that Parliament was ſuch a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wiſe, prudent and diſcreet perſons that</hi> England <hi>had ſcarce ſeen the like, and that it would have been very neceſſary and worthy ſuch an Aſſembly, to give a relation of the ſeries of Gods Providences all along to theſe very times; but that being very well known to them, he ſhould at preſent omit it, and proceed to the declaring how the Erection of this preſent Power was a ſuitable providence with the rest, by ſhewing them what a condition theſe Nations were in at its erection; every mans heart was then againſt another, every mans intereſt divided againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers, and almost every thing grown arbitrary:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170564:74"/>That there was grown up a generall contempt of God and Christ, the grace of God turned into wantonneſs, and his Spirit made a cloak for all wickedneſs and profaneſs; nay the axe was even laid to the root of the Miniſtry, and ſwarms of Jeſuites were continually wafted over hither to conſume and deſtroy the welfare of</hi> England: <hi>That the Nation was likewiſe then engaged in a deep warre with</hi> Portugall, Holland <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>ſo that the whole Nation was in a heap of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: but that this Government was calculated for the peoples intereſt (let malignant ſpirits ſay what they would) and that with humbleneſs toward God and modeſty towards them, he would recount ſomewhat in behalf of this Government. For firſt it had endeavoured to reform the Law: it had put into the ſeat of Juſtice men of known integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ability; it had ſetled a way for probation of Miniſters to preach the Gospell; and beſides all this, it had called a</hi> Free Parliament (<hi>bleſſed be God they that day ſaw a</hi> Free Parliament.) <hi>As for the Warres a Peace was with</hi> Sweden, Denmark, <hi>the</hi> Durch <hi>and</hi> Portugall, <hi>and one was likewiſe neer concluding with</hi> France. <hi>That theſe things were but entrances and doors of hope, but now he made no queſtion to enable them to lay the top ſtone of this work; he recommended to them this Maxime,</hi> That Peace though it be made, is not to be truſted further then it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170564:74"/>with intereſt. <hi>That the great work now lay upon this Parliament, was that the Government of</hi> Ireland <hi>might be ſetled in termes of Honour; That they would avoid confuſions, leſt forreign States ſhould take advantage by them: That as for himſelf he did not speak like one that would be a Lord over them, but as one that would be a fellow-Servant to them in this great affair. So to conclude; he deſired them to repair to their Houſe, and uſe their liberty in chooſing a Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Protectors ſpeech finiſhed, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers immediately repair to their Houſe, and there chooſe <hi>William Lenthall</hi> Eſquire Maſter of the Rolls to be their Speaker, which done they begin upon the <hi>Inſtrument for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The Queſtion is in the firſt place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>Whether the Legiſlative power ſhoald be in a ſingle perſon and a Parliament?</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorians endeavour by all means poſſible to perſwade that it ſhould be no Queſtion, but be carried abſolutely in the affirmative. This is as ſtrongly oppoſed by the greater part of the Houſe; and amongſt the reſt a Member who had all along ſtrongly oppoſed Monarchy, as incongruous to his intereſt, ſtood up and told them, <hi>That they could not but diſcern the ſnares that were laid to entrap the priviledges of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for his own part he declared that as God had
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170564:75"/>made him inſtrument all in cutting down Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in one perſon, ſo now he could not endure to ſee the Nations liberties ſhackled by another, whoſe right to the Government could be meaſured out no other wayes then by the length of his Sword, which was only that which emboldened him to command his Commanders.</hi> Many ſpeeches were made confirming what he had ſaid, and in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to a ſingle perſon.</p>
               <p>Theſe debates and diviſions upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors inſtrument were ſoon carried to his ear; and therefore (he fearing that in the end they would produce irreconcileable jarrs) reſolved to remedy them in time, and to put the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into a poſture more complacent to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns if poſſible; he goes therefore by water from <hi>Whitehall</hi> to <hi>Westminſter,</hi> enters the Painted Chamber, and ſends for thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament which were then ſitting, to whom he declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the God of heaven knew what great grief and ſorrow of heart it was to him, to find them falling into heats and diviſions: That he would have them take notice of this, that the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment made him a Protector whech made him a Parliament: That as they were intruſted with ſome things, ſo was he with others: That in the Gouernment there were certain Fundamentals, which could not be altered: As,</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:170564:75"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Government ſhould be in a ſingle perſon and a Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Parliaments ſhould not be perpetn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Militia ſhould not be truſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one hand or power, but ſo that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have a check on the Protector, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector on the Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That in matters of Religion there ought to be liberty of Conſcience, and that perſecution in the Church was not to be tolerated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the reſt of the things in the Government were examinable and alterable, as the State of affairs did require: That for his own part his heart was even overwhelmed with grief, to ſee that any of them ſhould go about to overthrow what was ſetled, contrary to their truſt received from the people, which cannot but bring very great inconveniences upon themſelves and the Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the ſumme of his perſwaſions to them; but fearing that this would not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently win them to his intereſt, he provided a recognition to be ſigned by every individuall Member, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do hereby promiſe and engage to be true and faithfull to the Lord</hi> Protector, <hi>and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and ſhall not (according to the tenor of the Indenture
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170564:76"/>whereby I am returned to ſerve in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) propoſe or give my conſent to alter the Government, as it is ſetled in one perſon and a Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was ſubſcribed by many of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, though the major part rather choſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the Houſe; the reſt conntinued ſitting to the end of the five Moneths, at which time the Protector ſeeing their dilatory proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that they delayed the ſetling him in the Government, the time being expired wherein his Inſtrument gave him leave (not letting ſlip one day nor ſarce an hour) diſſolves them.</p>
               <p>Some time after the time of this Parliaments diſſolution, was there a horrible terrible Plot diſcovered, againſt his Highneſs the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and his uſurped power: The firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of its effects was at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> came a Body of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 200 Cavaliers, and it being then the time of the Aſſizes there, they took away the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Commiſſions, clapt guards on all the Innes, till they had ſeized upon all the Horſes, then left the Town and marched towards <hi>Pool,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by their Captains; <hi>Wagſtaffe, Penrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docke,</hi> and <hi>Jones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Party at the ſame time ſurprized the Town of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and endeavoured to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170564:76"/>have taken the Caſtle; but being diſcovered, that deſign was prevented.</p>
               <p>There was likewſe a Party to the number of 800 or a 1000 men got together in <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meryſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Sherwood</hi>-Forreſt likewiſe in <hi>Nottingam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> there was a Party gathered together, but frighted with their own ſhadows, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed; as did likewiſe two parties which were upon <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> and <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Plot was ſaid to have been laid all over the Nation, though there were ſo few appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and all thoſe vaniſhed of themſelves, except that commanded by <hi>Wagſtaffe, Penrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docke,</hi> and <hi>Jones,</hi> which being purſued by Collonel <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntoncrooke</hi> out of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> into <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire,</hi> were by him and <hi>John Copleſton</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Sheriff of <hi>Devon</hi> totally routed, <hi>Penrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docke</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> taken, and <hi>Penruddocke</hi> with ſome others executed. For this ſervice the Protector afterwards dubbed the Sheriff of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von,</hi> and in token of more favour gave him the Sword wherewith he Knighted him.</p>
               <p>About the end of this year 1654, died that famous Antiquary and accompliſhed Scholler M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Selden</hi> of the <hi>Inner Temple,</hi> whoſe fame was ſo great in Forreign parts, that many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of known wiſdome and Learning, came
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170564:77"/>over on purpoſe into <hi>England</hi> to ſee and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him. Nor need any give him any larger Encomium, then the Right Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> gave him in the Pulpit when he preacht his Funerall Sermon, <hi>viz. That he esteem'd M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  </hi> Selden <hi>a man of ſuch vaſt parts and Learning, that he judged himſelf not worthy to carry his Books after him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Protector had a great while been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a mighty Fleet with all neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for ſome notable voyage; all the world ſtanding amazed at his preparations, and every one fearing thuir own States, they could not gueſſe whither his deſign tended. At length thoſe vaſt preparations produced two mighty Fleets, the one under command of Generall <hi>Blake,</hi> was fitted only for the Sea and ſent to the <hi>Streights;</hi> The other about two moneths after was committed to the charge of Generall <hi>Pen,</hi> who was to take aboard him a Land Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my commanded by Generall <hi>Venables.</hi> Theſe Land Forces being about 3000, were divided into the ſeverall Ships, which were in number 30 ſail of good Ships, but not provided with Proviſions neceſſary for ſo great an Army, nor ſo long a voyage; nor indeed could the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders provide themſelves things fitting, they not knowing whither, nor how farre they were to go.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:170564:77"/>
               <p>The 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1654, this Fleet ſet ſail for <hi>Portſmouth</hi> directly for the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> where the Generals had order to break open their Commiſſions, this being the appointed place of Rendeſvouz, whether having a freſh gale of wind and fair, they arrived on the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> and came all to anchor in <hi>Carlyle</hi>-bay, where preſently after they landed their men.</p>
               <p>The ſudden departure of theſe two great Fleets, made the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (who feared thry were deſigned againſt him,) to ſend an expreſs command to the Marqueſs of <hi>Leda</hi> then Governour of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to paſs into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the quality of an extraordinary Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, to ſee if he could poſſibly ſearch out the certainty of that grand Court ſecret: he accordingly being arrived in <hi>England,</hi> ſpent ſeverall days here, but having no ſatisfaction in that which he moſt of all deſired, returned back again.</p>
               <p>But to return to our <hi>Weſt-India</hi> voyage: whileſt the Fleet abode at the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> the Generals, Collonels and inferiour Officers look'd diligently after their reſpective charges; the Shallops brought in quarters out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are ſet up; the Coopers are ordered to trim the Watercaske: two Frigots are ſent to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Mevis</hi> to raiſe Men; the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170564:78"/>Generals ſtriving to compleat their Regiments at the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and form Regiments out of the Seamen to ſerve upon occaſion; and at length being in a full readineſs, they ſhipt about 6000 Men, and a Troop of Horſe (which the Iſlanders of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> had ſet out at their own charges) and on the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1655, ſet ſail from the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and ſix days after arrived at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> where there joyned with them 1300 Voluntiers, (the Planters ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants both here and at the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> being ready and willing to go, upon condition that their time ſhould go on, and that they might as well be free by ſerving the State as their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) ſo though the Fleet were encreaſed by 20 ſail of Dutch Merchant-men (which were ſeized on at the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> for trafficking there contrary to the Articles of Peace between the two Nations) yet were all the Ships as full as they could well hold, though there were hardly Proviſions (the chance ſuppoſed which might in probability retard the voyage conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) for half the number that was aboard; but as they were, they ſet ſail from thence, and ſteered their courſe directly for <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> whither on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Aprill</hi> the whole Navy arrived, and came within ſight of <hi>Sto</hi> 
                  <hi>Domingo,</hi> upon which place their firſt and chief enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was deſigned: Being here a generall
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170564:78"/>Counſell of Warre was called, and by their whole votes it was agreed, that Generall <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nables</hi> ſhould land with his Forces: and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the next day lands 7000 Foot, a Troop of Horſe, and three days Proviſion about ten or twelve leagues to the weſtward of the Town. The Souldiers were half out of their wits, with conſideration of the great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Gold which they expected to find in the Town, inſomuch that every man encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his fellow with hopes of being made for ever; there ſeem'd ſuch an univerſall courage over the whole Army (though more out of the hopes of an imaginary gain then true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour) that without doubt had not thoſe hopes been quell'd, there might have been almoſt a certainty of victory preſuppoſed. But the Generall (I know not whether according to his Inſtructions, or the deſire he had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the whole ſpoil to himſelf, or at leaſt get it into his own hands) finding their deſigns and intentions, immediately cauſes Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made, that upon the taking of <hi>Sto</hi> 
                  <hi>Domingo,</hi> (which he might perhaps have had had this Proclamation been kept in) no man ſhould preſume to plunder either Money, Plate or Jewels, or take or kill any tame Cattell whatſoever, upon pain of death. This without doabt was in great part the ruin of the buſineſs;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170564:79"/>for had the Souldiers had but the hopes of ſo great a gain as they promiſed themſelves, they would have undergone thoſe dangers and ſtreights which ſo much weakned them, with thrice the courage they went, and without that vexation of ſpirit for an imaginary loſs, which deſtroyes a man more then the pain and travell of his body; however their ſtreights were great, for they paſſed through almoſt unpaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Woods, through which they were forced to cut their way, and where they found not a drop of freſh Water, ſo that what with the heat of the Sun, which was exceſſive and pierced their very brains, and the Drought which that heat cauſed, together with their diſcontent of mind, (and we know ſorrow is likewiſe dry) they were moſt of them grown faint, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled for ſervice.</p>
               <p>Having marched thus two dayes and half, and with much difficulty paſſed thoſe Woods, (though without any oppoſition but what thoſe Woods themſelves, the heat of the Sun, and want of freſh Water made) they at length joyned with Collonel <hi>Bullards</hi> Brigade, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of three Regiments of Foot, (which Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall <hi>Pen</hi> bad landed on the ſide of a Bay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Leagues from the Town, where like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a freſh-water River disburdned itſelf, and which was the appointed place for conjunction
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170564:79"/>of the whole Body, which conſiſted now of 9000 or 10000 men, though moſt fainting, ſcarce able to walk much leſs fight for nothing; but the Army being thus conjoyned, they make what ſpeed to march on, not doubting but to poſſeſs the Town on the ſuddain. There firſt advances a forlorne hopes of about 500 men, commanded by Captain <hi>Cox</hi> the chief guide for the place, after whom followed the main Body of the Army. Being thus come within four Miles of the Town, the Spaniards with a ſmall Party of Horſe ſuddainly encounter the forlorn hopes, and in an inſtant routed them, forcing them through the next Regiment, which they likewiſe put to flight, and had purſued their victory to the ſlaughter of moſt of them, had not the whole Army come up to their relief. Whereupon the Spaniards in very good order and without any conſiderable loſs, retired to a Fort cloſe by the Woods; but there were near 50 of the Engliſh ſlain, beſides Captain <hi>Cox</hi> chief guide (as I ſaid before) for the place.</p>
               <p>The Generall having received this loſs, and finding that the chief reaſon of his mens weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was want of Water, retreats back again to the River before ſpoken of, reſolving that he would having refreſhed his men, carry on his deſign againſt all reſiſtance; and to that effect cauſes ſcaling Ladders to be made, and two
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170564:80"/>ſmall Drakes with a Mortar-peece and Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-ſhells to be landed from the Fleet, which were to be convoyed by Water, near the Town. And ſo being in readineſs they once more advance towards the Town, ſome guides having undertaken to lead them by a private way, without danger of the Fort; but miſſing the intended way, they fell again into the ſame path, and into worſe diſgrace then they had formerly received; for the Spaniards ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving certain advice by the <hi>Negroes</hi> and <hi>Molat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes</hi> of the Engliſh March, reſolved to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in their paſſage, and according as they had reſolved it ſo they performed it. For on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1655, the whole Army approaching near a Brick Fort (built there by the Spaniards, and defended with nine good peeces of Ordnance, and 300 men) were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſuddain charged by a Party of the Enemy, which lay undiſcovered among the Trees. Theſe reſolute fellows though not above 70 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, having fired a volley of Shot upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne hopes, flew in upon the Engliſh (who were already wearied and almoſt choaked with thirſt) with their ſteel Lances, and that with ſuch fury, that in a moment they routed both them and the Generals Regiment, with near half of the Army, who flying back into the Rear, poſſeſſed them there with ſuch a pannick
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170564:80"/>fear, that every man began to fly and ſhift for himſelf, whileſt the Spaniards purſued their victory with infinite ſlaughter, finding no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but what was made by that only in this action valourous Gentleman Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Haines,</hi> who reſolved not to ſtir a ſtep, but fighting valourouſly in the midſt of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſold his life at no cheap rate. At length the Spaniards weary of killing, retreated with ſeven Engliſh Colours, which they carried with them as ſure Trophies of the victory. There were ſound dead of the Engliſh 600 up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, 300 wounded, beſides 200 more who flying into the Woods to ſave themſelves, were afterwards knockt on the head by the <hi>Molettoes</hi> and <hi>Negroes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this diſtaſter, the Army that night drew up to the Spaniſh Fort, and planted a Mortar-peece in a convenient place, and all things were in readineſs for a battery, when on a ſuddain the Army was commanded to draw off, and without doing any harm to march to their old Watering place in the <hi>Bay.</hi> For what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or by whoſe counſell this was done, I have not the capacity to gueſs.</p>
               <p>And now they were come into the <hi>Bay</hi> there wanted victuals, ſo that they were forced to go out in Parties to fetch ſome in, whence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them came ſhort home, being knockt on
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170564:81"/>the head by the <hi>Negroes:</hi> Till at laſt forced by neceſſity, they were fain to eat the Horſes of their own Troop. In this miſerable condition they remained ſome days, till at length a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was taken to ſhip them, which being finiſhed the third of <hi>May,</hi> the whole Fleet ſet Sail, and on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> arrived in the Port of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> whither they bent their courſe from <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and though they failed of their firſt enterprize there, yet here they had better ſucceſs, for they ſoon poſſeſſed themſelves of the chief Town called <hi>Oriſtano,</hi> where the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my began to take up their habitation, and to plant. This hath ſince proved a pretty thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Iſland, profitable to the Engliſh, and an ill neighbour to the adjacent Spaniſh Iſlands.</p>
               <p>Shortly after (but one after the other) the Generals <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Venables</hi> returned into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whom at their arrivall the Protector in thanks for the ſervice they had done, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Tower.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning this unfortunate voyage: Let us now ſweeten it a little with the noble exploit performed by Generall <hi>Blake</hi> in the <hi>Streights,</hi> whither he was ſent with a gallant Fleet to ſcour thoſe Seas of Turkiſh Pirats, which took and deſtroyed many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Ships, making ſlaves of their perſons. He firſt ſeeks for them out at Sea, but miſſing
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170564:81"/>his aims there, reſolves to ſeek them where they were to be found: And firſt on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> arrives at <hi>Algier,</hi> where the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable both in quantity and quality lurked, be anchored without the Mold; he ſends a Meſſenger to the <hi>Dye,</hi> requiring reſtitution of ſuch Engliſh Ships as had been taken by them, and that the Captives be immediately releaſed. The <hi>Dye</hi> having provided a large preſent of Beef and Muttons, and other freſh proviſions alive, returns the Meſſenger with them, and this anſwer to the Generall: <hi>That the Ships and Captives already taken were of particular men, and therefore it lay not in his power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them, without the generall diſcontent of all his Subjects. Yet as for the Engliſh Captives that were there, if he pleaſed to redeem them he ſhould, and he would ſet a reaſonable and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent price upon their heads. And that if the</hi> Generall <hi>thought good, they would conclude a peace with him; and for the future offer no acts of hoſtility on their part, to any of the Engliſh Ships or Natives.</hi> This anſwer ſeemed ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the Generall, and accordingly the Captives were redeemed, and a peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>This buſineſs thus diſpatched at <hi>Algier,</hi> he bends his courſe for <hi>Tunis,</hi> where having ſent a Summons to the <hi>Dye,</hi> he received but a rough
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170564:82"/>complyance, they wholly ſlighting his deſires. And having drawn their Ships under the Caſtle of <hi>Goletta,</hi> thought them ſecure, ſending him word; That <hi>there were their Caſtles of the</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta, <hi>and their Ships and Caſtles of</hi> Porto Feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, <hi>that he ſhould do his worſt and not think to ſear them with his Fleet.</hi> This reſolute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer exaſperated both the Generall and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who reſolved to be revenged for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence. A Counſell of War is called, who conclude on a reſolution to burn thoſe nine Ships in <hi>Porto Ferino,</hi> which they effected thus. Every Ships Boat being manned with ſtout and reſolute Mariners, are ſent into the Harbour to aſſault and fire the Ships, whileſt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, Vice-Admirall, and Rear-Admirall, ply continued broad ſides upon the Caſtle, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from endammaging their Boats, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſtout aſſault fire the Ships, and return back again with the loſs of but 25 men, and 48 wounded. This noble action of Generall <hi>Blake</hi> reſounded to the praiſe of the Engliſh Nation, as far as the Port of the <hi>Orand-ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi>

With him the Lord <hi>Whitlock</hi> who had ſome time been Ambaſſador there, ſoon concluded a firm League both of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and defenſive between theſe two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the effects of which had been felt to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in ſome parts of Chriſtendome, had <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwell</hi> lived much longer then he did.</p>

               <p>The greateſt ſervice which theſe Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals did the Protector, was the forcing the Delinquents in their reſpective Provinces, to pay in the Decimation of their Eſtates for old offences; which performed, he himſelf find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Major Generals to be an eclipſe of his glory, reduced them again to their former Stations.</p>
               <p>Another deſign of the Protectors to raiſe Money, ſhould have been the introduction of the <hi>Jewes</hi> into <hi>England:</hi> Here was two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds to be got, which made the care of the encreaſe of the Church of Chriſt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170564:84"/>lye extreamly. So he propoſes it to ſeverall Miniſters for their approbation, alledging that ſince <hi>there is a promiſe for their converſion, means muſt be uſed to that end, which is the preaching of the Goſpell,</hi> and that cannot be had, except they be permitted to reſide where the Goſpel is preached. But notwithſtanding theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, the deſign was declaimed againſt both by Clergy and Laity; ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> were denied their Re-admiſſion, though 'tis ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Protector ſwallowed down ſome part of that ſweet promiſed morſell.</p>
               <p>The Spaniard having had certain advice of the attempt and repulſe of the Engliſh at <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaniola,</hi> and their Poſſeſſion of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> thought this a ſufficient breach of the peace, (though there was never any peace made with him beyond the Line, he alwayes taking thoſe Engliſh Ships he could light on and maſter, though they went to traffick thither) preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes a ſeizure of all the Engliſh Merchants perſons and goods then reſident in <hi>Spain;</hi> ſo that the War begins to grow hot on both ſides the Tropick. The Protector therefore orders the Generals <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Montague,</hi> to block up <hi>Cadiz,</hi> the chief Port-Town of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and whither his Plate-Fleet uſed yearly to come. He likewiſe endeavours a peace with <hi>France,</hi> (who had had Wars with <hi>Spain</hi> for a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170564:84"/>long time) to which the Cardinall <hi>Mazarine</hi> conſenting, it was eaſily concluded on. The French King being ſo inhumanely unworthy as (upon <hi>Mazarines</hi> inſtigations) to baniſh his Majeſty the King of Scots, and the reſt of the late Kings children his neareſt relations, out of his Dominions; though indeed he could do no more but forbid their re-entrance, they being already gone to further the making of a peace with him, who had ſo unjuſtly expoſed them from their inheritances.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Fleet under <hi>Montagues</hi> and <hi>Blakes</hi> Command, had for a good while in a manner beſieged <hi>Cadiz</hi> by Sea, but could by no exaſperations be drawn out of their harbour to fight them, the Spaniards thinking it a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer policy to let the Engliſh beat at Sea, and at laſt be forced to depart for want of proviſions, rather then venture either men or Ships againſt them, who they had ſeen ſo well experienced in ſuch terrible Sea-fights with the Hollander. But the Engliſh found in <hi>Wyers</hi> Bay in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> a convenient ſupply both of Water and proviſions, which proved a great deal nearer, then the Spaniard imagined they would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fetch it.</p>
               <p>Hither were the Generals gone for freſh Water and proviſions, having left only a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of ſeven Ships, under Command of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                  <hi>Stainer,</hi> before the Port of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> to have an eye upon whatever Ships ſhould paſs in or out at that Port. Being thus plying to and fro thereabouts for ſome dayes, it happened that a ſtiff gale of Wind forced <hi>Stainer</hi> to ſtand out to Sea, where he ſpied a very pleaſing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, part of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Fleet coming from the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and making directly for <hi>Cadiz;</hi> he was ſomewhat to the Lee-ward, made up towards them with all the Sail they could poſſibly, and after ſome two hours hard plying, Captain <hi>Stainer</hi> with his Ship, the <hi>Speaker,</hi> the <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> and the <hi>Plimouth</hi> Frigots got up to them, (the other four of the Engliſh never being able to come up) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently theſe three engaged them. Though the Spaniards were eight tall Ships or Galleons, yet in ſhort time the Spaniſh whole Fleet was ſpoiled, whereof one was ſunk, two burnt, two ran aſhore and were bulged, one eſcaped, and two remained in the hands of the Engliſh, one whereof had a great quantity of Plate and Cochenill in her, the other was for the moſt part laden with Hides. In theſe Ships many perſons of note were taken, who together with the Ships were ſafely convoyed home, to the great joy of the Protector, who made a particular day of Thankſgiving to God for ſo great a booty.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:170564:85"/>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the late great Plate prize, yet our Protector is ſtill neceſſitated for Moneys; therefore to procure ſome, and out of a longing deſire he had to have his power confirmed to him by the people, hoping that a new Repreſentative might grant him that which the firſt denied or refuſed, iſſues out his Writs for the Election of another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Yet remembring the ſpeeches and carriages of many Members in the late Parliament, he gave ſecret advice to the Sheriffs in moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not to permit them, if poſſible to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; however the people in moſt Countries chooſing according to reſpect, his ſecret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice would ſcarce hold water.</p>
               <p>The 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1656, this Parliament met firſt at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where they found the ancient priviledge of Parliament broken, by a promiſe impoſed upon every individuall Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, before he ſhould be permitted to ſit in the Houſe; to wit, that he would not act any thing prejudiciall to the Prebyterian Government; which promiſe ſo to be made, ſo diguſted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Members, that they chooſe rather to return home; but the major part aſſenting to it, entring the Houſe, choſe S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170564:87"/>they made a gallant reſiſtance, yet in four hours ſpace they were driven out of their Ships, which though poſſeſſed by the Engliſh, yet could not eaſily be brought away, ſo they were by them fired to the number of ſixteen ſmall and great. This noble attempt coſt the Engliſh but 48 men, and 120 wounded. The Spaniards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the loſs of their whole Fleet, had many hundreds of men ſlain on the ſhore, and in the Forts and Breſt-works, beſides thoſe which loſt their lives in the Ships.</p>
               <p>For this noble exploit the Protector by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Parliament, ſent a Diamond Ring worth 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>, for a preſent to Generall <hi>Blake.</hi> And Captain <hi>Richard Stainer</hi> who led on the firſt Squadron, was at his coming to <hi>England,</hi> for this and his former ſervice, Knighted.</p>
               <p>This year happened a Conſpiracy of other ſort of men then Cavaliers; for on the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1657, at a Houſe in <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> ſeverall diſcontented perſons who had been formerly of the Army, were apprehended, who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to have Rendeſvowzed on <hi>Mile-end-Green,</hi> and ſo have marched into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to augment their Party. Store of Arms were taken, and the number of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors being many, they were diſpoſed of in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall priſons. Major Generall <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Vice-Admirall <hi>Lawſon,</hi> Collonel <hi>Rich,</hi> and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170564:88"/>Major <hi>Danvers,</hi> were ſecured as the chief Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders. This was called the Plot of the fifth-Monarchy-men.</p>
               <p>The Protector out of a deſire he had to keep the Spaniards to it every where, makes a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate agreement with <hi>France,</hi> to ſend out a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade of his beſt Infantry, (which the French extreamly wanted) to aſſiſt them in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Theſe were begun to be raiſed about the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1657; and about the latter end of the Moneth, having had a very fine paſſage into <hi>Picardy;</hi> joyned with thoſe Forces command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Marſhall of <hi>Turene.</hi> Over theſe Sir <hi>John Reynolds</hi> (one of the Protectors Knights, but formerly Commiſſary Generall of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in <hi>Ireland</hi>) was appointed Commander in chief, and Collonel <hi>Morgan</hi> was made Major Generall.</p>
               <p>But to return a little to our affairs at home: The Parliament had long been debating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſettlement of his Highneſs, and had almoſt concluded of it; when on a ſuddain a Paper was ſent into the Houſe, deſiring his Highneſs advance of Title. Upon this the grand machine of Government was printed, entituled, <hi>An humble Petition and Advice,</hi> humbly entreating that his Highneſs would be pleaſed to change his Title of Protector, to that of King. This was extreamly averſe to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170564:88"/>his nature, who (God bleſs us) would be a Servant and not a Maſter of his Country. He knew Monarchy to be odious both to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and (as he ſaid) to the people; and therefore he gave the Parliament this poſitive anſwer in the painted, Chamber, <hi>That he could not accept the Government under the Title of a King.</hi> Whereupon the Parliament voted that Protector ſhould be the Title of the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; and the Petition and Advice being altered accordingly, nothing now wanted to the making it a Law, but his Highneſs appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: So a Conference is deſired with him, which granted, the Protector on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1657, meets the Parliament in the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chamber, where S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>The Petition and Advice of which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Lines were the heads, being in the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chamber read to the Protector, was by him paſſed, though with much ſeeming reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; he declaring, <hi>That he came not thither that day as to a triumph, but with the moſt ſerious thoughts that ever he had in all his life, being to undertake one of the greateſt burthens, that ever was laid upon the back of any humane creature; ſo that without the ſupport of the Almighty, he muſt neceſſarily ſink under the weight of it, to the damage and prejudice of theſe Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That this being ſo, he muſt ask the help of the Parliament, and the help of all thoſe that fear God, that by their prayers he might receive aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from the hand of God, ſeeing nothing but his preſence could enable him to the diſcharge of ſo great a truſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That ſeeing this is but an Introduction to the carrying on of the Government of theſe Nations; and foraſmuch as there were many things which could not be ſupplied without help of Parliament, he thought it his duty to deſire their help; not that he doubted of it, for he believed that the ſame spirit that had led the Parliament to this, would eaſily ſuggest the reſt to them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That nothing ſhould have induced him to have undertaken this intollerable burthen to fleſh and bloud, had he not ſeen that it was the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments care to anſwer thoſe ends for which they had engaged, calling God to witneſs, that he would not have undergone it, had he not ſaw it to be determined by the Parliament, to make clearly for the liberty and intereſt of the Nation, and preſervation of ſuch as fear God; and that if theſe Nations be not thank full to them for their care therein, it would fall as a ſin upon their heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To conclude, he recommends to them other things which would tend to Reformation, and the diſcountenancing of vice, and encouragement to good men and vertue, deſiring them that they would not be wanting in any thing that might make for the good of the Nations.

And accordingly they paſſed a Bill for their adjournment from the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1657, to the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following, the ſaid 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> being the day appointed for his Highneſs ſolemn inveſtiture.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I do in the preſence and by the name of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

               </p>
               <p>This Oath adminiſtred, and ſome attending Ceremonies performed, a Herald ſtood up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, giving ſignall to a Trumpet to ſound three times; after which he did by Authority and Direction of Parliament, publiſh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his Highneſs, Lord Protector of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> requiring all perſons to yeeld him due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>This Proclamation ended, the Trumpets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain founded, and ſome Souldiers, and others ſet there on purpoſe, ecchoed forth, <hi>God ſave the Lord Protector.</hi> Then was he again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by an Officer at Arms, ſtanding on the ſtairs, which was anſwered again by the ſame
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170564:91"/>Ecchoes of ſome of the Souldiery.</p>
               <p>Theſe Ceremonies ended, the Protector at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by all the Officers of State, went into the Palace-yard <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in his Robes, where entring his Coach, he returned in State to <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us now return a little to our Engliſh Forces, which went over under S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> to aſſiſt the French King, who this year about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> advance into the Spaniſh Territories; and joyning with the Marſhall <hi>Turine,</hi> the whole Army according to agreement, ſate down before the <hi>Mardike</hi>-Fort, which lyes about two Miles from <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirke,</hi> and was judged of concernment to the taking of <hi>Dunkirke</hi> it ſelf, (which place accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to agreement, the French Army in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration our helps, was joyned with theirs to the ſiege, before any other ſervice, and if taken to deliver it into the Engliſh hands) after a ſhort ſiege <hi>Mardike</hi> was upon Articles ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to the French and Engliſh, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a Garriſon of Souldiers placed in it; whom the Spaniards ſuddenly after endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remove, by giving a fierce Camiſado to the Fort, when the Armyes were drawn into their Winter-Quarter; but it proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall. For though there were no want of courage in their charge, yet the Engliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170564:92"/>them; though they not content with this expulſe, adventured upon it again, where though the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> who commanded in chief, performed things worthy of ſo gallant a Prince, yet were they forced to a ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the ſweetneſs of theſe ſucceſſes made many men rejoyce, there arrived news to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter it, <hi>viz.</hi> the death of that noble and thrice valiant Generall <hi>Blake,</hi> who had done ſuch noble and gallant ſervice for his Country; had beaten the Hollanders (that potent Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at Sea) forcing them to run into their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for ſhelter, he had lately burnt the mighty King of <hi>Spains</hi> Weſt-India Fleet in his own harbours, and under his own Caſtles; and to ſhorten his praiſes in a word, had he been but as loyall as he was valiant, his praiſe might juſtly have exceeded the ancient Semi-gods, (and the Pyramids of his ſame have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured with glory to eternity; though he was now buried obſcurely in <hi>Harry</hi> the ſevenths Chappell, and neither Statua nor Tombe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to his memory.</p>
               <p>The Lord Protector having how enſured his greatneſs, begins to conferre Titles of honour upon his Children, his eldeſt Son <hi>Richard</hi> is made Chancellour of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford;</hi> and his younger Son <hi>Henry</hi> ſent over Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty

               <p>His Highneſs had in this intervall of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Seſſions, made choice of ſundry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to fill up his other Houſe, or Pageant-Houſe of Lords; which becauſe poſterity may know what perſons they were, every one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt having heard both of them, and known the riſe of moſt of them, I ſhall here inſert their Names.</p>

               <p>This is the Catalogue of thoſe Lords (at leaſt ſuch as were ordered to be ſo eſteemed by the Protector) which were by him created Peers of the Land, (though without any other Title then that of bare Lord (how unfit many of them were to be ſo, I'le leave to any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man to judge, ſince (though there might ſome perſons of honour he pickt out amongſt them) men raiſed by the power of the Sword,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170564:94"/>yet were the greateſt part of them ſuch as had either raiſed themſelves fortunes out of theſe Kingdomes diſtractions, and ſo were as deeply engaged againſt their King and Country as himſelf, which made them indeed the fitter for his deſignes, as being moſt likely to ſtand true to his intereſt.</p>
               <p>But the time of the prorogation of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being expired, they make their appearance in the Houſe, the Pageant-Houſe of Lords like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſitting according to ancient cuſtome, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Protector coming, ſends to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to tell them that he attended them in the Houſe of Lords, whither the Speaker with the reſt of the Members immediately go, to whom he makes a very fair ſpeech; telling them in concluſion, that if they would go on to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his deſignes, <hi>that they ſhould be called the bleſſed of the Lord, and the generations to come would bleſs them,</hi> &amp;c. But the Parliament ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fourth Article of the Petition and Advice, which ſayes, <hi>That no Members legally choſen ſhould be excluded from perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duty but by conſent of Parliament,</hi> immediately proceed to the calling over and re-admitting of thoſe Members, which had formerly been ſecluded by the Protector, to his Highneſſes no little diſcontent.</p>
               <p>The Parliament being now full, began to be
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170564:94"/>angry at the Houſe of Lords, and to eſteem it only as a Pageant-Parliament, ſet up on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to mock them; for it was ſtrange to them, that that power which was created but by a part of a Parliament, ſhould have a negative voice over a ſull Houſe. And at length they went ſo far as to queſtion the Protectors power in calling them or Authorizing them to ſit as a Houſe of Peers, which he finding, thought it not fitting to let buſineſſes of this high nature run too far. So on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> he goes to his Houſe of Lords, and by the Maſter of the black Rod he ſends to acquaint the Houſe of Commons of his being there; ſo the Speaker, and the reſt of the Members repairing thither, and ſtanding without the Bar, his Highneſs ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under a Chair of Eſtate, made a large Speech to them; and in concluſion told them, <hi>That it did concern his intereſt as much as the publick peace and tranquillity of the Nation, to terminate that Parliament, and therefore he did now put an end to their ſitting.</hi> So the Houſe in obedience to his commands, diſſolved.</p>
               <p>And now the Protector having a plot near diſcovery, orders the ſettlement of the Militia of <hi>London,</hi> (but in ſuch mens hands as would certainly be faithfull to his intereſt) this he doth under pretence to perſwade the people how much he labours for their ſecurity; which to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170564:95"/>make them more ſenſible of, preſently after ſucceeds the diſcovery of this horrible terrible plot, and herein not only his own perſon muſt be endangered, but the Tower and Mews muſt be furprized both at one time, the City of <hi>London</hi> fired, and all the Souldiers about it to be put to the Sword; and all this monſtrous Gunpowder-work to be performed by not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty perſons, of whom the Reverend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> muſt from a priſoner in the Caſtle, take poſſeſſion of the Garriſon of <hi>Hull;</hi> yet theſe two, with about twenty or thirty others of meaner rank, were clapt up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tower, and after ſome time being brought before the high Court of Juſtice, erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe, were charged with high Treaſon: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That they had traiterouſly and maliciouſly endeavoured to raiſe force and leavy warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Highneſs and the Government, and to ſubvert and alter the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That they had traiterouſly declared, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and promoted</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>eldeſt Sonne to the late King</hi> Charles, <hi>to be King of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That they had held intelligence with the

Theſe were the heads of the Charge againſt them. <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Henry Slingſby</hi> was likewiſe charged for endeavouring to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Governour of <hi>Hull,</hi> and perſwading him to ſurrender that Garriſon to the King: for theſe they were both condemned as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, though there were no witneſs againſt D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hewit,</hi> but the Confeſſion of one <hi>Mallory,</hi> (who pretended himſelf to have been in the Plot,) and accordingly on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> he and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>Many endeavours were uſed by ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality for the ſaving of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>Hewit,</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Cleypool</hi> begging on her knees; but nothing could pacifie the Protector, who was reſolved theſe two worthy perſons ſhould be ſacrifices to his tyranny.</p>
               <p>There were likewiſe executed for this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Collonel <hi>Edward Aſhton,</hi> who was hangd, drawn and quartered at <hi>Mark</hi> lane end in <hi>Fan</hi>-Church ſtreet, <hi>Edmond Stacy,</hi> who ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame death in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> and <hi>John Bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> who ſuffered like wiſe in <hi>Cheapſide;</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike death of the laſt being very well worth remembrance.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:170564:96"/>
               <p>As the death of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hewit</hi> was a prodigie to to the world, ſo there could no leſs then a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie attend it. For ſome time before his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there came up the <hi>Thames</hi> as farre as <hi>Greenwich</hi> a Whale of a very great length and bigneſs, it being the wonder of the all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders to imagin, that ſuch a Creature of ſuch a vaſt bigneſs, ſhould either find the way up, or be content to leave (eſpecially at that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year) its naturall Element.</p>
               <p>But let us return again to the ſcene of warre in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the Engliſh and French Armies are joyned together, and ſet down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> with a reſolution to take it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſtirred; whereupon <hi>Don John D' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> knowing the importance of the place, it being the Key of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and next after <hi>Graveling</hi> a frontier to <hi>France;</hi> beſides the continuall ſupplies of Money it brought his Treaſury, and the many inconveniences would enſue by the Engliſh poſſeſſing it, reſolves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hazard his whole Army then not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt its relief.</p>
               <p>But whileſt he is getting of force together, the Engliſh and French forces had in a ſmall time run their trenches to the counterſcarp, and ſtill incroached nigher and nigher to the wall; which the Spaniards having advice of, and fearing leſt their relief might come too
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170564:96"/>late, make what haſte poſſible to its a ſhſtarce: the better to effect which, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> dreins moſt of his Garriſons, and compleats a body of 10000, with theſe he marches poſt haſt through <hi>Fuornes,</hi> and encamps within a mile and a half of the Marſhall <hi>Turines</hi> quarters; of which the Confederates having advice, immediately diſlodg with a body of 15000 or thereabouts, leaving ſtill ſufficient to guard the trenches and make good the approaches, in caſe the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould attempt a ſally. With this force of men and 10 pieces of Cannon <hi>Turine</hi> faces the Spaniard; the Engliſh foot were drawn up in four great battalions, and were ordered to give the firſt onſet on four other battalions of the Spaniards foot which had taken the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ground, by placing themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three riſing hillocks, and were ſeconded by <hi>Don Iohn</hi> himſelf. The Engliſh were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lord <hi>Lockhart,</hi> who having firſt commanded a forlorne hope of about 300 Muskiteers to mount the ſand hills, which he ſeconds with his own Regiment of Foot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Collonel <hi>Fenwick,</hi> who ſtoutly maintained their ground, though the Spaniards played down continuall volleys of ſhot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and the French refuſed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond them, ſent another conſiderable Brigade to their relief, which made no dallying, but
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170564:97"/>immediately fell in amongſt the Spaniſh Foot with the buttend of their Musquers, who after ſome ſmall reſiſtance, not having been uſed to ſuch kind of Club-Law, left the field and fled; whereupon the French Horſe ſeeing the good fortune of the Engliſh Foot, fell in upon the Spaniſh Horſe, who few or none of them ſtood the charge, except thoſe under the commands of the Dukes of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a gallane reſiſtance, were forced, more overpowred with number, then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached in valour, to quit the field after the reſt.</p>
               <p>In this Battell a great part of the Lord <hi>Lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harts</hi> Regiments were either ſlain or wounded; and amongſt the reſt, Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> who led them on, was ſlain by a Musket-Bullet of the Spaniards ſide. The ſlaughter was very great, the French Horſe after the Battell having little or no mercy in the purſuit, ſo that there were near 3000 ſlain, beſides many the Spaniſh Nobility who were taken, moſt wounded, and many of which after died of their wounds. This totall rout of the Reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Army, as it encouraged the beſiegers, ſo it totally diſcouraged the beſieged: for they could expect no relief neither by Sea nor Land, the Engliſh Frigots blocking them up by ſea, and <hi>Don John D' Auſtria</hi> not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170564:97"/>his Army by Land. But yet the Marqueſs of <hi>Leda</hi> to ſhow he was not totally diſheartned, with a ſtrong Party ſallies out of the Town, and falls upon the French Quarters, which was counted rather an act of deſperation, then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or hopes of ſucceſs; for here he who was the life of the buſineſs, and whoſe life might ſtill the action in being, received a wound, of which he ſhortly after died; and with him the Spaniards poſſeſſion of the Town of <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> For thoſe within after the French and Engliſh had for fourteen dayes together continued to play their Mortar-peeces upon the Town; the inhabitants weary of the ſport, and deſpairing, beat a Parly, and deſire to come to capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which being granted, the Town was ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred up upon Articles, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Town ſhould be ſurrendred up, with all their great Guns, ſtore of victuals, maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines of Arms and Ammunition without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezlement whatſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Officers and Souldiers ſhould march out with Drumms beating, Colours flying, two piece of Ordnance and their baggage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That they ſhould have free liberty to march to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Inhabitants ſhould remain indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in their perſons or goods, and enjoy their

               </p>
               <p>Theſe Articles being thus concluded on and ratified by his Majeſty of <hi>France,</hi> the ſtrong Town of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was ſurrendred, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion taken of it by the King of <hi>France</hi> and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall in perſon on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1658.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards then marching out to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of about 1700 Horſe and Foot, the Engliſh had the poſſeſſion of the Town immediately delivered over to them, wherein they found 136 braſs piece of Ordnance, with great ſtore of Ammunition and Proviſion in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines: it was immediately engarriſoned by three Regiments of the Engliſh Foot then there, and a Regiment of Horſe to be under the command of the Lord <hi>Lockhart</hi> was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately raiſed, and as faſt as poſſibly could be ſent over thither.</p>
               <p>But whileſt the Armies lay before <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> lying then at <hi>Calice,</hi> the Lord <hi>Faulconbridge</hi> (who was made one of the Protectors bloud by marrying the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> one of the Protectors Daughters) was ſent to <hi>Calice</hi> to complement that King and Cardinall; in return of which, Mounſieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nani</hi> Nephew to <hi>Mazarine</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Grequi,</hi> are ſent to ſalute his Highneſs, who are here very nobly entertained, and ſent back

               </p>
               <p>But whileſt the Armies are thus triumphing in <hi>Flanders,</hi> God ſends the Protector a ſcourge at his own doors; for his dearly beloved Child, the only darling of his eyes, the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Cleypool,</hi> on whom he had placed the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170564:100"/>whole affections of his ſoul, was by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging hand of the Almighty (for the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud of his Prophet and ſervant ſo lately added to the great maſs before ſhed) on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> taken out of the world, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of her dearly loving Father, whoſe very image 'tis ſaid ſhe was, and into whoſe praiſes many are pleaſed to laſh, and advance her fame to the skies (either out of fear, flattery, or to ſhow the world how they can command their Pens to any ſubject,) but amongſt the reſt he moſt pleaſes me, who is pleaſed to ſtile her an <hi>Amazon,</hi> perhaps not unfitly; but <hi>de mortuis nil niſi bonum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She dying at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> was from thence the fourth day after conveighed by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (with a great many Barges in mourning accompanying her corps) from thence to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and there laid in the Painted Chamber (where a ſtately Herſe was prepared for her,) till about 12 a clock at night, when with a Noble, but no over ſtately Funerall pomp, her body was conveighed into <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeavenths Chappell, and there interred in a place purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for it.</p>
               <p>Hir death was the cauſe of ſo great grief to the Protector hir Father, as moſt affirm, that it was one chief cauſe of his, which followed not long after; for having been very penſive

               <p>He could not be perſwaded that his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was mortall, being an <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, firmly believing, <hi>That as God had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to that height, ſo he had ſome farther work for him to do;</hi> he having about him ſuch ſycophantine Chaplains, one of which but three days before his death praying by his bed ſide uſed this expreſſion, <hi>Lord we beg not of thee life, for that we are already aſſured of; but that thou wouldeſt be pleaſed to eaſe him of his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having had ſeverall diſcourſes with divers of his Privy Counſell, who earneſtly preſſed him according to the firſt Article of the <hi>Petition and Advice,</hi> to name his Succeſſor, being am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to leave what he could no longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy himſelf, to his own line, named his Sonne <hi>Richard Cromwell</hi> for ſucceeding Protector af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death.</p>
               <p>The night before his departure (ſays one) he was obſerved to have uttered this Prayer:</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:170564:101"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord, I am a miſerable creature, yet I am in Covenant with thee through grace; and I may, I will come unto thee for thy people. Lord thou haſt made me, though very unworthy, a mean inſtrument to do them ſome good, and thee ſervice; and many of them had too high value of me, though others would be glad of my fall. But Lord, howſoever thou diſpoſeſt of me do good for them. Give conſiſtency of judgment, one heart and mutuall love unto them. Let the Name of Chriſt be glorious throughout the world. Pardon ſuch as delight to trample upon the aſhes of a worm, and pardon the folly of this ſhort Prayer, even for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was on Thurſday night, and on Friday morning being the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1658, (his twice auſpicious day) he ſhewed all the ſigns of a dying perſon, though he continued ſtill alive till about three a clock in the afternoon, when his great ſoul expired, and went to give an account of his actions in this life, to the great High Court of Juſtice, who had ſo often called men to account before his High Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice here: yet there he might have this ſurety, which could not be given here, that there are neither <hi>Trepanners</hi> nor <hi>falſe Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Privy Counſell upon advice of his death, immediately aſſembled together, and being ſatisfied of his departure out of this world,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170564:102"/>and that he according to the firſt Article of the <hi>Petition and Advice,</hi> had appointed his Sonne <hi>Richard Cromwell</hi> to ſucceed him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Lord Protector of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. they agreed to his choice, and the Officers of the Army having likewiſe aſſented thereto; they immediately ſent the Lord Chamberlain to acquaint the Lord <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Cromwell,</hi> that they were coming to wait upon him; whereupon he attended their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Lord Preſident being the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, made a Speech to him in the name of the whole Counſell: wherein he let him know, how deeply the Counſell was affected with grief for the death of his Princely Father, and that they could not but very much condole with him for ſo great a loſs; and withall to acquaint him, that his late Highneſs his dear Father, having in his life time, according to the <hi>humble Petition and Advice,</hi> declared and appointed him to ſucceed in the Government of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the Counſell had taken the matter into conſideration, and thereupon reſolved it, and had cauſed a Proclamation to be drawn up which was paſſed by the Counſell, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and conſented to by the Officers of the Army, and ſubſcribed by the members of the Counſell, and the Lord Major of <hi>London</hi> and Officers of the Army with one conſent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170564:102"/>his Highneſs was to be proclaimed Lord Protector of theſe three Nations of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was to be made publick the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at nine of the Clock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this his Highneſs returned anſwer, <hi>That he had a very deep ſenſe, as well of his own ſorrow for the loſs of his Father, as of the faithfulneſs of the Counſell of the City of</hi> London, <hi>and Officers of the Army, toward his deceaſed Father and himſelf in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion; and likewiſe the ſenſe he had of the great weight of the Government now by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence thruſt upon his ſhoulders, which he could no better way hope to ſuſtain, than by theirs and the good people of the Nations Prayers, whoſe peace and proſperity he would endeavour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the utmoſt of his power,</hi> &amp;c. ſo he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the Counſell.</p>
               <p>Thus you have a full relation of the end of <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> Lord Protector of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe valour only moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to that height, and for which only he deſerves remembrance or applauſe; and by which he raiſed his Family to that pitch, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with the beſt of the Kingdome, and the Nation to that glory, that forreign Princes both feared and envied it.

Your Highneſs, your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and people, reap the benefit of his prayers and ſucceſſes; but alas! this our</hi> Moſes <hi>(your dear and bleſſed Father) the ſervant of the Lord is dead, and ſhall we not weep! Though we weep not for him, we cannot but weep for our ſelves. We
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170564:106"/>cannot but look after him, crying,</hi> Our Father, our Father, the Chariots of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and the horſemen thereof; the fiery Chariot indeed of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe fury and ambition had ſet the whole Nation in flames and combuſtion.</p>
               <p>Nor are the reſt of thoſe forreign Miniſters which were then in <hi>England,</hi> viz. the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> the Agents for the <hi>Hans-Towns, Florence, Venice,</hi> and <hi>Genua,</hi> backward in coming to lament with his Highneſs for the death of his Father, and deſire the continuance of that league; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and amity, which was maintained and granted by him. To which the Lord Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or returned anſwer, that there could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greater argument uſed for his continuance offriendſhip with any Kingdome or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, then by telling him <hi>that his Father had contracted it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> leſs complyant to his deſires then <hi>England</hi> had been, they thence ſend their addreſſes and promiſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; ſo that his Government ſeemed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where to begin with a great deal of ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and fair promiſes of a long continuance. In <hi>Scotland</hi> likewiſe, Generall <hi>Monke</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Vicegerent there, publiſhed a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the better ſecuring the peace of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: declaring</p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:170564:106"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, That no perſon then beyond the ſeas, or out of the Dominions of this Commonwealth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Except Maſters of Ships, or Seamen belonging to Ships of this Commonwealth, ſhould after the firſt of</hi> December 1658, <hi>preſume to come into</hi> Scotland, <hi>without Licence from the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, or his Counſell in</hi> England, <hi>the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty or Counſell of</hi> Ireland, <hi>or his Highneſs Counſell of</hi> Scotland; <hi>as they would anſwer it at their perils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, That ſuch Perſons as ſhall arrive in</hi> Scotland <hi>after the firſt of</hi> December, <hi>having ſuch a Paſſe, ſhall at their arrivall be bound to give intimation to the Governour of the next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Garriſon, who is to examine them, and ſee that their Paſſe be not counterfeit: and for all thoſe who ſhall arrive before the firſt of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, <hi>they are to make their appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governour of the next adjacent Garriſon, who is to examine the cauſe of their coming into</hi> Scotland, <hi>and if he find them to be perſons ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, to apprehend and ſecure them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, That no Maſter of any Ship, ſhall either coming from beyond the Seas, or going out of</hi> Scotland, <hi>bring in or carry out any perſon whatſoever who hath not ſuch a Paſſe as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Proclamation was publiſhed under high pretences of preventing the deſign of the Cavalier party there.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:170564:107"/>
               <p>And now the time approached for celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Funerall Pomp of his Highneſs <hi>Oliver</hi> late Lord Protector, of which great care had been taken, and no imaginary ſtate neglected: for he being firſt embowelled, was from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> carried to <hi>Somerſet Houſe,</hi> where his Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies was ſet up in ſtate after this manner. Three Rooms were firſt hung with black Cloth, adorned each of them with a Canopy and Chair of State of the ſame. The fourth where the Corps was and the Effigies did firſt lie, was hung with Velvet, and adorned with Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons and Banners in moſt Noble ſort; after which, the Effigies was removed into another Room, and there expoſed to publike view, ſtanding in Princely manner upon an aſcent under a Canopy of State, with a Scepter in one hand, a Globe in the other, and a Crown on his head, after the ancient manner of the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> his Armour lying by him, and the Banners, Banrols and Standards placed round about hm, and ſo continued untill the ſolemnizationi of the Funerall-Pomps and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which were performed on the 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1658, in form following:</p>
               <p>The Effigies being taken down by ſeverall of the Protectors Gentlemen, was with a rich Canopy carried over it, taken and placed in a Chariot, covered with black Velvet, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170564:107"/>with Plumes and Scutcheons, and drawn by ſix plumed Horſes, covered to the heels with black Velvet: Then the Train began to march, betwixt the Rails ſet up on purpoſe, from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet Houſe</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on each ſide of which ſtood the Souldiers with black Ribbons on their red Coats, and their Enſignes furled and covered with a vail of Cypres. And firſt went a Knight-Marſhall on Horſeback, with his black Truncheon tipt with gold, attended by his Deputy, and ſeverall other Officers to clear the way. Next followed the Poor men of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> two and two in mourning Gowns and Hoods: Then the Servants of thoſe Perſons of Quality attended the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: Then the Servants of the deceaſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, in their reſpective places and orders: Then the Servants of the Lord Mayor, Sheriffs and Aldermen of <hi>London:</hi> Then the Servants attending the Ambaſſadours and Agents of Forreign Princes: After them the Poor Knights of <hi>Windſor</hi> in their Gowns and Hoods: Then the Clerks, Secretaries and other under-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers belonging to the Army, Admiralty, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, Navy and Exchequer: Then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the Fleet, and Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Then the Commiſſioners for Exciſe, the Committees of the Army and Navy: Then the Commiſſioners for approbation of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters:
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170564:108"/>Then the Officers belonging to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Counſell and both Houſes of Parliament: Next followed the Protectors Phiſicians: Then the Field-Officers and generall Officers of the Army: Next the Aldermen of <hi>London:</hi> Then the Maſters of the Chancery, and the deceaſed Protectors Counſell at Law: Then the Judges of the Admiralty, the Maſters of Requeſt with the Judges in <hi>Wales:</hi> Then the Barons of the Exchequer, the Judges of both Benches, and Lord Mayor of <hi>London:</hi> Then the Perſons allied to his Highneſs. and the Members of the Lords Houſe: After them the Agents of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, Genoa,</hi> the <hi>Hans-Towns,</hi> and other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Miniſters: The <hi>Holland</hi> Ambaſſadour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: The <hi>Portugall</hi> Ambaſſador, whoſe Train was born up by four Knights of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Chriſt: The French Ambaſſadour whoſe Train was likewiſe born up by four Perſons of Quality: The Lords Commiſſioners of the Great Seal: The Lords of the Privie Counſell: Then followed the Chief Mourner, with thoſe Perſons who bore up his Train: moſt of the Perſons of Honour were in Cloſe Mourning, and were in their diviſions diſtinguiſhed by Drumms and Trumpets, and by a Standard or Banner, and by a Mourning Horſe, of which there were eleven in all, four covered with black Cloth, and ſeven with Velvet; Theſe
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170564:108"/>being all paſt in order, the Effigies followed in the Chariot, with ſix Banner Rolls born on each ſide, and eight Perſons bearing the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall pieces of the deceaſed Protectors Arms, all which were attended by Heralds; after whom came <hi>Garter</hi> principall King at Arms, attended by a Gentleman on each ſide bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed: Then followed the Horſe of Honour, in very rich Trappings of Gold embroidered upon crimſon Velvet, and adorned with white, yellow and red Plumes, which was led by the Maſter of the Horſe: And laſt of all followed the Protectors Guard of Halbertiers, with the Warders of the Tower.</p>
               <p>In this State was the Effiigies conducted from <hi>Somerſet Houſe</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where it was taken off the Chariot, and in the ſame State as it was firſt taken out of <hi>Somerſet Houſe,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Abby Church, and placed under a woodden Monument ſtately erected for it, with the Bannors and ſix Enſignes of Honour placed about it; the Corps having been ſome days before buried in a Vault purpoſely provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it in <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> Chappell, over which a ſtately Monument was intended to be erected over it, but the after ſodain Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of State hindred that undeſerved remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him.</p>
               <p>With all this Pomp and Splendor were the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170564:109"/>Funerall Ceremonies of the deceaſed Lord Protector performed, ſo prodigall were the Counſell of State to the very memory of their ſo beneficiall a Maſter, not regarding at all the Debts or other inconveniences which they might run the Nation into, by ſo vaſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe; ſo that in requitall to him, or to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate themſelves with his Sonne, they were ſo vain as to extend the pomp and expence of his Funerall, beyond that of any Engliſh King ſince <hi>William</hi> the Conquerours time.</p>
               <p>The deceaſed Protector had in his life time contracted a firm League both offenſive and defenſive with the King of <hi>Swetheland,</hi> which cauſed the now Protector his Sonne, upon the Swedes deſires, to man out a great Fleet for his aſſiſtance, againſt the Dutch who aided the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> his enemy. Between forty and fifty ſail of gallant Ships were ſent forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of the Lord <hi>Mountague:</hi> this Fleet having ſpent neer ſix moneths in the <hi>Sound,</hi> even to the time of the diſſolution and annulling of that Power that ſet them forth, returned home having done nothing worth the mention.</p>
               <p>The Protector now to ſtrengthen himſelf, by the advice of his Counſell calls a Parliament, and Writs are iſſued out for their appearance on the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1658, whether they

                     </opener>
                     <p>I beleeve there are ſcarce any of you here, who expected ſome moneths ſince to have ſeen this great Aſſembly at this time, in this place in peace, conſidering the great and unexpected change which it hath pleaſed the all diſpoſing hand of God to make in the midſt of us. I can aſſure you, that if things had been according to our own fears and the hopes of our enemies, it had not been thus with us. And therefore it will become both you and me, in the firſt place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and adore the great God, poſſeſſor of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, in whoſe hands our breath is, and whoſe are all our wayes, becauſe of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo to acknowledg his goodneſs to theſe Lands, in that he hath not added ſorrow to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170564:110"/>ſorrow, and made the period of his late Highneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes life, and that of the Nations peace to have been in one day.</p>
                     <p>Peace was one of the bleſſings of my Fathers Government, a mercy after ſo long a Civill War, and in the middeſt of ſo great diviſion which that war bred, is not uſually afforded by God unto a people in ſo great meaſure.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of God and theſe Nations which he engaged in, met in all the parts of it, as you well know, with many enemies and great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. The archers privily and openly ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him, yet his bow abode in ſtrength, and the arms of his hands were made ſtrong by the hands of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to himſelf, he died full of dayes, ſpent in great and ſore travail, yet his eyes were not waxeddim, neither was his nature or ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated; as it was ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able even to the laſt.</p>
                     <p>As to theſe Nations, he left them in great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour abroad, and in full peace at home, all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> dwelling ſafely, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man under his Vine and under his Figtree, from <hi>Dan</hi> unto <hi>Beerſheba.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is gone to his reſt, and we are entred into his labours; and if the Lord hath ſtill a bleſſing for theſe Lands, <hi>(as I truſt he hath)</hi> as our peace hath been lengthened out to this day, ſo ſhall
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170564:110"/>we go on to reap the fruit, and gather the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, of what his late Highneſs hath ſown, and laid the foundation of.</p>
                     <p>For my own part being by the providence of God, and the diſpoſition of the Law, my Fathers Succeſſor; and bearing that place in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I do, I though it fit for the publick good, to call a Parliament of the three Nations, now united and conjoyned together into one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, under one Government.</p>
                     <p>It is agreeable not only to my truſt, but to my principles, to govern theſe Nations by the advice of my two Houſes of Parliament. I find it aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the humble Petition and Advice, <hi>(which is the corner ſtone of this building, and that which I ſhall adhere unto)</hi> that Parliaments are the great Counſell of the chief Magiſtrate, in whoſe advice both he and theſe Nations may be moſt ſafe and happy. I can aſſure you I have that eſteem of them: And as I have made it the firſt Act of my Government to call you together; ſo ſhall I further let you ſee the value I have of you, by the anſwers that I ſhall return to the Advice that ſhall be given me by you, for the good of theſe Nations.</p>
                     <p>You are come up from your ſeverall Countries, as the heads of your Tribes, and with hearts I perſwade my ſelf to conſult together their good; I can ſay I meet you with the ſame deſires, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170564:111"/>nothing in my deſignes, but the maintenance of the Peace, Laws, Liberties both Civill and Chriſtian of theſe Nations, which I ſhall always make the meaſure and rule of my Government, and be ready to spend my life for.</p>
                     <p>We have ſummoned you at this time, to let you know the ſtate of our affairs, and to have your advice in them, and I beleeve a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was never ſommoned upon ſo important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                     <p>It is true as I have told you, we are through the goodneſs of God at this time in peace, but it is not thus with us becauſe we have no enemies; there are enough both within us and without us, who would ſoon put an end to our peace, were it in their powers, or ſhould it at any time come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their powers.</p>
                     <p>It will be becoming of your wiſdomes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the ſecuring of our peace, againſt thoſe who we all know are, and will be our implacable enemies; what the means of doing this are, I ſhall refer unto you.</p>
                     <p>This I can aſſure you, that the Armies of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are true and faithfull to the peace and good intereſt of theſe Nations, and it will be found ſo, and that they are a conſiſting body and uſefull for any good ends; and if they were not the beſt Army in the world, you would have heard of inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170564:111"/>by reaſon of the great arrear of pay which is now due unto them, whereby ſome of them are reduced to great neceſſities: but you ſhall have a particular account of their arrears, and I doubt not but ſome conſideration will be had thereon in ſome ſpeedy and effectuall way. And this being matter of money, I recommend it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the Houſe of Commons.</p>
                     <p>You have you know a warre with <hi>Spain,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the advice of Parliament: he is an old enemy, and therefore it will be neceſſary both for the honour and ſafety of theſe Nations, that the war be vigorouſly proſecuted.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, the conſtitution of Affairs in all our neighbour Countries and round about us (as well friends as enemies) are very conſiderable, and calls upon us to be upon our guard both at Land and Sea; and to be in a poſture able to maintain and conſerve our own intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Great and powerfull Fleets are preparing to be ſet forth into theſe ſeas, and conſiderable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of ſeverall Nations and Kings, are now diſputing for the maſtery of the Sound with the adjacent Iſlands and Countries, among which is the Roman Emperour, with other Popiſh States; I need not tell you of what conſequence theſe things are to this State.</p>
                     <p>We have already interpoſed in theſe affairs, in ſuch manner as we found it neceſſary for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170564:112"/>of <hi>England,</hi> and matters are yet in ſuch a condition in thoſe parts, that this State may, with the aſſiſtance of Gods provide, that their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences may not prejudice us.</p>
                     <p>The other things that are to be ſaid, I ſhall refer to my Lord Keeper <hi>Fines,</hi> and cloſe up what I have to ſay, with only adding two or three particulars to what I have already ſaid.</p>
                     <p>And first I recommend to your care the people of God in theſe Nations with their concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the more they are divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the greater prudence ſhould be uſed to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The good and neceſſary work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation both in manners and in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice, that profaneneſs may be diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced and ſuppreſſed, and that Righteouſneſs and Juſtice may be executed in the Land.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I recommend to you the Proteſtant cauſe abroad, which ſeems at this time to be in ſome danger, having great and powerfull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and very few friends, and I hope and believe that the old Engliſh zeal to that Cauſe is ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly my Lords, and you Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, That you will in all your debates maintain and conſerve love and unity among your ſelves, that therein you may be the pattern of the Nation, who have ſent you up in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170564:112"/>peace and with their prayers, that the ſpirit of wiſdome and peace may be among you, and this ſhall alſo be my prayer for you, and to this let us all add our utmoſt endeavours for the making this a happy Parliament.</p>

               </floatingText>
               <p>This was the Protectors ſo much applauded Speech to his Parliament: which finiſheed, the Lord <hi>Fines began,</hi> and after having enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the deceaſed Protectors great endeavours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the peace of the Nation, and his Highneſſes following his ſteps in the calling of this preſent Parliament for the three Nations joyntly, he recommended more effectually to them <hi>the wars abroad, and the probabilities of homebred diſturbances,</hi> deſiring their proviſion to maintain the one, and care to prevent the other: the Parliament having every one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Oath formerly taken by <hi>Olivers</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, not to alter the Government, were returned to their Houſe, and the Protector to <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Houſe of Commons being returned to their Houſe, ſpent muce time about the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of their Elections, and expelling ſeverall Members out of the Houſe (but cauſing others to be elected in their ſteads) under pretence of being Malignants, and having born Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament in behalf of their lawfull Soveraign; and not only expelling them, but
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170564:113"/>diſabling them from being elected or choſen as Members of future Parliaments; ſo though this Parliament was eſteemed one of the freeſt that had been called ſince 1641, yet it was not free indeed.</p>
               <p>The Houſe having as far as they could recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their Members and Elections, proceed to the calling to an account of all thoſe who had been entruſted with the Cuſtomes, Excize, Taxes or other Revenue of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and to conſider of the preſent ſtate of the Revenues, and ſome ways to pay the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears of the Army, Navy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Debts; but this buſineſs being put off, by delays never came to any effect.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe proceed to the drawing up of a Bill (for it never came to be either Act or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance) which ſhould be intituled, <hi>An Act of Recognition of his Highneſs right and Title to be Protector and Chief Magiſtrate of the Commonwealth of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and the Dominions and Territories there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging.</hi> Many demurs were there in this debate, and ſeverall praevious Votes to be paſſed before this Bill could be committed; as whether the Parliament ſhould conſiſt of two Houſes; and whether this Houſe ſhould tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act with the Perſons ſitting in the other Houſe, as a Houſe of Parliament: This buſineſs took
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170564:113"/>up a great deal of time; the Protectorians ſtood ſtifly for it, and the Commonwealthſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as ſtong againſt it, alledging, that to treat with thoſe men as a Houſe of Lords, was to enſlave themſelves more deeply then ever they had been before. That they ſhould now by it clearly evince to the world their folly, perjury and villany, that whileſt they had taken their Oaths to be true and faithfull to govern with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Houſe compoſed of the Peers of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhould now both break their Oath, and ſubject themſelves to ſuch as were ſcarce Peers to the Commons: That if they did but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Creator of this Houſe of Peers (as they were called,) they could not but foreſee the neceſſary thraldome they muſt run themſelves into, theſe being all ſuch as were made ſure to his intereſt, and were ſo many ſure Votes for whatever arbitrary actions he might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; and if it were thought unlawfull for the Biſhops to ſit in the Houſe of Lords, becauſe they were accounted ſo many ſure voices for the King, how much more might theſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, who were certainly ſo many ſure voices for the Protectorall intereſt, being all created by it. Yet notwithſtanding theſe Arguments, the Vote was at length carried on the Protectorian ſide, and Reſolved, <hi>That the Houſe of Commons would tranſact with the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170564:114"/>Perſons then ſitting in the other Houſe as a Houſe of Parliament, during the preſent Parliament:</hi> but with this Proviſo, <hi>that it was not intended thereby to exclude ſuch Peers as have been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Parliament, from their priviledge of being duly ſummoned to be Members of that Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt the Parliament are thus purſuing their Votes to ſettle the Protector in <hi>England,</hi> the French and Spaniard are endeavouring to conclude a Peace betwixt themſelves, and to leave the Engliſh in the lurch; which howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it then and ever ſince went vigorouſly on, yet are not the Conditions ſpoken of, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on either ſide, to the full-conſummating of it.</p>
               <p>During the Seſſions of this Parliament, on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Strangways,</hi> formerly a Major in the Kings Army, was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to death in the Preſs-yard in <hi>Newgate,</hi> for refuſing to plead to his Indictment, for having cauſed his Brother-in-Law, one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Fuſſell</hi> an Attorney of <hi>Dortſetſhire,</hi> to be ſhot in the head as he ſate writing in his Chamber-window, of which he died. The magnanimity, nobleneſs and pe nitence of Major <hi>Strangways</hi> at his death, deſerves this memory.</p>
               <p>This Parliament took into conſideration the Caſes of divers Perſons who had been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170564:114"/>in the time of the late deceaſed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; Maj. Gen. <hi>Overton</hi> is ſent for out of the Iſle of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and releaſed: The Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> is likewiſe releaſed out of <hi>Windſor</hi>-Caſtle, upon the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> his giving 20000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> ſecurity, that he ſhall demean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf peaceably for the future, and not joyn with, abet, or have any correſpondence with the enemies of the Lord-Protector, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. Severall other Perſons of Quality were likewiſe by them releaſed out of the Tower. Maj. Gen. <hi>Brown</hi> likewiſe who had by the long Parliament in 1649, been diſabled from bearing any Offices in the City, is by them reſtored, and made capable of all Offices, priviledges and precedencies there, and the long Parliaments Vote of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1649, made in his prejudice, vacated.</p>
               <p>The Quakers to promote their Turbulencies, on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> ſent a Paper into the Houſe, ſealed and directed on the outſide, <hi>For the Speaker of the Commons aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; theſe are for him to read to the Commons.</hi> The inſide contained a Declaration, entituled, <hi>A Declaration to the Commons aſſembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: Delivered the ſixth day of the ſecond Moneth called</hi> April 1659, <hi>to the then Speaker of the ſaid Houſe.</hi> This Declaration contained many ignominious ſcandals, thrown by thoſe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170564:115"/>Fanatiques both upon the Magiſtracy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; for which the Parliament expreſs their Reſentment to the Declarers, requiring them to repair to their reſpective habitations, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to their callings, and ſubmit themſelves to the Laws of the Nation, and the Magiſtracy they lived under.</p>
               <p>But whileſt we are talking of this crabbed ſowr generation, let me give an account of one paſſage of them in <hi>New-England.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour there being troubled with their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances, and abuſes both of Magiſtracy and Miniſtry; made a Law for their baniſhment, that if any of them came thither again, they ſhould at their firſt coming be whipt and ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; at the ſecond loſe their Ears; but if they ſtill perſiſted, their lives ſhould be forfeit. According to this Law, ſome of them ſtill being obſtinate, notwithſtanding they had been whipt at <hi>Boſton,</hi> returned. Whereupon the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ordering their ears to be cut off according to Law, ſhortly after he received a Letter from one <hi>Humphrey Norton</hi> a Quaker, from about fifty Miles from <hi>Boſton;</hi> which becauſe of the horribly blaſphemous curſes in it, I ſhall inſert the heads of. Thus he begins:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accurſed are thy Rulers thou Town of</hi> Boſton, <hi>for they are become the High Prieſts ſervants, and have cut off the Saints right Ears.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:170564:115"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accurſed are thy Teachers, for they are the troop of Robbers, which murther in the high way by conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accurſed are thy people, who vote up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto their actions of bloodſhed, murther, and cruelty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accurſed is that Counſell, that ſits to ſhed the blood of the innocent, as hath been done in thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accurſed is thy Governour, who paſt the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt his own ſoul, he being forewarned in it by expreſs words from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accurſed is that Hangman that did it, as he is called ſo is his Name; he is ſervant to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, one of his familiar spirits,</hi> (<hi>his Name in the Hebrew tongue is</hi> Abbadon) <hi>and his Maſter which firſt caſt them into priſon, and now hath cauſed him to cut off their Ears, muſt be bound in the Lake of oblivion for a thouſand years; his Name there ſhall rot, and his poſterity periſh,</hi> &amp;c. (and ſo he goes on in moſt horrid curſes, and in the end)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The curſe of God light upon thee</hi> John Indicot; <hi>for my brethren and companions ſake, the curſe of God reſt upon thee, thy deeds thou ſhalt anſwer for, as ſure as ever thou conſentedſt to that deed, thou ſon of a Murderer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lucifer <hi>thou curſed Bird, who dareſt attempt to ſay thou ſpeakeſt from Heaven, get thee down
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170564:116"/>into the loweſt hot Lake, thou lyar, for within the gates of Hell is thy habitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the ſumme of his Letter, which was thus directed. <hi>Let this Letter be delivered with care to the hands of</hi> John Indicot, <hi>Governour of</hi> Boſton <hi>ſo called: haſt, haſt, haſt.</hi> But I have digreſſed too much, in diſcourſing thus long about this perverſe generation.</p>
               <p>Let us now return to the Parliament, who had long been debating about the Writs iſſued out by the Protector, for Election of Members for <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſerve in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Parliament. The debates hereon were the more long and tedious, in regard thoſe two Nations had never yet by any Preſident, the liberty to have their Members ſit in the Engliſh Parliament; but at length a Preſident was made, and it was reſolved, that the Members that returned to ſerve for <hi>Scotlad</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould continue to ſit as Members for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Parliament.</p>
               <p>About this time happened a very ſad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> the Town of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Michaels</hi> being near wholly conſumed with fire, to the great loſs and utter undoing of moſt of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, beſides the loſſes ſuſtained by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who had goods in Ware-houſes on ſhore.</p>
               <p>But now about the latter end of <hi>March</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:170564:116"/>1659, began the firſt ſparks of diſcontent to break out, which afterwards burſt into ſuch a flame, that it conſumed the Protectors great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Eſtate. The originall cauſe of this diſtemper, there's very few, but thoſe that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it can tell; but the firſt appearance of it was in a repreſentation preſented on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> by the Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi> to his Highneſs, in behalf of the Army, the heads of which were as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They preſſed their urgent wants by reaſon of their Arrear-pay, and deſired redreſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They complained that they who had born the brunt of the War, were now derided and like to be laid by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That many</hi> Cavaliers <hi>were lately come out of</hi> Flanders, <hi>and had dangerous meetings in and about</hi> London.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That the faithfull ſervants of the Good Old Cauſe, were affronted by malignant and diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That Liſts of the actuall Tryers of the late King printed in red letters, were ſcattered about, as if they were appointed for deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That Suits were commenced at common Law againſt many well affected perſons, for things they had tranſacted as Souldiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>That the famous actions of the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and his late Highneſs in and ſince</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:170564:117"/>1648, <hi>were vilified and evil ſpoken of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all theſe Circumſtances clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced a declenſion of the Good Old Cauſe, which they were reſolved to aſſert; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſired that his Highneſs would be pleaſed to repreſent theſe things to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and procure their remedies: And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that he would recommend to them the preſent neceſſities of the Souldiers for want of pay, and that ſatisfaction might be given to the Militia-Forces.</p>
               <p>The Militia of the City of <hi>London</hi> took it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kindly, that the Army had been pleaſed to mention ſatisfaction to be made for the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia-Forces, they therefore inſtigated by their chief worthy Commanders <hi>Tichborn</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> draw up a repreſentation, confirming their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions with the Army to ſtick to the Good Old Cauſe, which they likewiſe accompany with a Letter to the Lord <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> to be communicated to the generall Counſell of the Officers of the Army, declaring their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to go along with them in whatever they ſhould undertake, for the pretended good of the Nations.</p>
               <p>Theſe Declarations and Remonſtrances both of the Officers of the Army, and City-Militia, were foreſeen by the Parliament to intend no good to them; they therefore in hopes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170564:117"/>them, vote that there ſhould be no meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or generall Counſell of Officers, without conſent and by Order of his Highneſs the Lord Protector; and that no perſon ſhould have any Command either by Sea or Land in any of the three Nations, who ſhould refuſe to ſubſcribe, that he will not diſturb the free meetings in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, of any the Members of either Houſe of Parliament, or their Freedome in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and Counſells.</p>
               <p>The Protector himſelf was likewiſe fearfull of theſe proceedings, and meetings of the chief Officers of the Army; he therefore ſends to them theſe Votes of the Houſe: Whereupon on the 22 of <hi>April</hi> after they had ſufficiently ſought God by prayer, <hi>Deſborow, Fleetwood,</hi> and other the chief Officers, with moſt of the Army at their heels, came to the Protector, and forced him to ſign a Delaration and Commiſſion, ready prepared for the diſſolving the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Commiſſion was directed to the Lord <hi>Nathaneel Fines,</hi> Lord Keeper of the great Seal, who coming to the Houſe of Lords, ſent the Uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the black Rod to the Houſe to deſire their attendance on the Lords, but they refuſed to give him entrance; but underſtanding there were Guards in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, they thought it beſt to adjourn, which they did till the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Munday being the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:170564:118"/>whereby they prevented both their formall and forceable diſſolution.</p>
               <p>But the next day being the 23 of <hi>April,</hi> the Proclamation ſigned by his Highneſs the Lord Protector, for the diſſolution of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was publiſhed; the Contents of it were as followeth.</p>

               <p>BY the diſſolution of the late Parliament, the power over the Nations is devolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of thoſe who devolved it, they being then the only viſible force (I will not ſay power) in theſe Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> the chief Officers of the Army, who firſt of all begin to modell their own Family, which they did by caſhiering thoſe of the Protectorian faction (for ſome ſuch there were in the Army) <hi>viz.

                  <hi>Pryn</hi> continued there, and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted highly with the Juncto, of the priviledge which he and the reſt of the ſecluded Members had to ſit, which only a little diſturbed, and made them (who were loath to hear right diſputed) adjourn till the afternoon; when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Pryn</hi> attempting again to enter, was impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Troop of Horſe and two Companies
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170564:121"/>of Foot, which were there ready to guard this piece of a Parliament, againſt thoſe whom they pretended were intruders.</p>
               <p>And thus this Parliament ſate in quiet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and to the end they might be no further diſturbed, voted, <hi>That all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons heretofore Members of that Parliament, which had not ſate in this Parliament ſince the year</hi> 1648, <hi>nor had ſubſcribed the Engagement in the Roll of Engagement of this Houſe, ſhould not ſit in the Houſe till further order of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They likewiſe publiſhed a Declaration, wherein after a large and ſpecious Preamble, they declared; <hi>That they were reſolved (through the gracious aſſiſtance of God) to apply themſelves to the faithfull diſcharge of the truſt impoſed in them, and to endeavour the ſettlement of this Commonwealth upon ſuch a foundation, as may aſſert, eſtabliſh and ſecure the properties and liberties of the people in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to all, both as men, and as Chriſtians, and that without a ſingle Perſon, Kingſhip or Houſe of Peers; and that they ſhould vigorouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the carrying on of Reformation ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and ſo often declared for; to the end there might be a godly and faithfull Magiſtracy and Miniſtry upheld and maintained in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the glory and praiſe of our Lord Jeſus
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170564:121"/>Chriſt, and to the reviving and making glad the hearts of the upright in the Land.</hi> By ſuch fair pretences did they begin to gull the people.</p>
               <p>And immediately, becauſe they could not have time as yet to appoint a Counſell of State, (the uſuall dependant of a Parliament ſince 1648,) they for the preſent erect a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Safety, conſiſting of <hi>Fleetwood, Haſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig, Vane, Ludlow, Sydenham, Salway, John Jones, Lambert, Deſbrough, Berry</hi> and <hi>Scot.</hi> In imitation of this was that Committee of Safety I ſuppoſe erected afterwards by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But the Counſell of State being ſhortly after nominated, whatever power they had, was void, though 'tis true moſt of the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned were members of it.</p>
               <p>The Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> made by the Protectors is likewiſe by them broken, and the old Seal uſed by the Parliament in 1651, voted to be the Seal of the Houſe, and no other. <hi>Eaſter</hi> Terme is alſo by them adjourned, to the great diſcontent of many perſons, who had then ſuits depending againſt many Members, eſpecially againſt <hi>Vane</hi> and <hi>Haſlerig.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Parliament now thinking themſelves fixt in their authority, begin to buſtle ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but eſpecially they take care to pleaſe the Army who had made them a Parliament, which they do by paſſing Votes, <hi>That effectuall care
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170564:122"/>be taken for ſatisfying their arrears, and paying them their pay in due order for the future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this Parliaments reentrance into the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Government of theſe Nations, there happened a ſad accident in the Town and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of <hi>Southwould</hi> or <hi>Soulbay</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> where neer 230 dwelling-Houſes were wholly conſumed with fire; all which was but a ſpark to the fire might have been kindled in this State, had they continued in power.</p>
               <p>The Army likewiſe at this time put up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratory Petition to this Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they deſired ſeverall things, as they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, towards the ſettlement of the Nation; to which the Parliament gave them theſe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive anſwers, for they durſt indeed do no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the liberty of the perſons, and property of the Eſtates of the free people of theſe Nations, ſhould be preſerved inviolable according to Law, under the Government of a free State or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, without a ſingle Perſon, Kingſhip, or Houſe of Peers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That there ſhould be a juſt and due regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That all perſons who profeſſed one God in Trinity, and acknowledged the Scriptures, ſhould have liberty of conſcience, provided it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170564:122"/>not to Popery or Prelacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That a godly and faithfull Goſpell-Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Miniſtry ſhould be encouraged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities and Schools of learning ſhould be countenanced and reformed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That none but men of approved godlineſs, and whoſe intereſts ſuited with the Good Old Cauſe, ſhould be admitted to employments in State.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>That an Act ſhould be made for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſales of all Kings, Queens, Princes, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, and Chapters Lands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they endeavour to pleaſe the Army by complying with their deſires.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding the fickle eſtabliſhment of this Houſe, the States of <hi>Holland</hi> court them by their Ambaſſadour, who on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> had audience in the Houſe; but perhaps thoſe States might have more reaſon to do ſo then others, theſe being the men who firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan that War with them, which almoſt totally ruined them.</p>
               <p>And now on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May, Richard Cromwell</hi> Eſq; late Lord Protector of theſe three Nations, makes a free reſignation of that Government to the Parliament, which the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had before taken away without his leave or conſent. His reſignation or rather ſubmiſſion ran thus:</p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:170564:123"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have peruſed the Declaration and Reſolve you were pleaſed to deliver me the other Night; and for your information, touching what is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſaid Reſolve, I have cauſed a true ſtate of my Debts to be tranſcribed and annexed to this Paper, which will ſhew what they are and how they were contracted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to that part of the Reſolve whereby the Committee are to inform themſelves, how far I do acquieſce in the Government of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as it is declared by this Parliament: I truſt. my paſt carriage hitherto hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted my acquieſcence in the will and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, and that I love and value the peace of this Commonwealth, much above my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments; and I deſire that by this, a meaſure of my future deportment may be taken, which by the aſſiſtance of God ſhall be ſuch as ſhall bear the ſame witneſs, having I hope in ſome degree learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather to reverence, and ſubmit to the hand of God, then be unquiet under it. And (as to the late providences that have fallen out amongſt us) however in reſpect to the particular engagements that lay upon me, I could not be active in making a change in the Government of theſe Nations; yet through the goodneſs of God I can freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in it being made, and do hold my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged (as with other men) I expect protection from the preſent Government, ſo to demean my
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170564:123"/>ſelf with all peaceableneſs under it, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to the uttermoſt of my power, that all in whom I have intereſt do the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he who was lately Protector of theſe three Nations, craved protection from his <hi>Quondam</hi> Subjects; and thus eaſily did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign thoſe three Kingdomes, which his Father had got with ſo much hazard of his body, if not of his ſoul.</p>
               <p>His Brother alſo <hi>Henry Cromwell,</hi> late Lord Lieutenant int <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon the Parliaments advice ſurrendred his Government; and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>John Jones, William Steel</hi> Eſquire, Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Mathew Thomlinſon, Robert Goodwin,</hi> and <hi>Miles Corbett</hi> Eſquire, were in his ſtead ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Parliament, to be Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for the Government of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> Generall <hi>Monke</hi> though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes not up his Government to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet holds a fair correſpóndency with them, and by his and the reſt of the Officers of his Armyes, declare and keep a complyance to their Government, which he punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The Parliament endeavouring ſtill more and more to oblige the Army, paſs an Act of oblivion and indemnity for all force or violence formerly put upon the Houſe; yet nevertheleſs to reſtrain them for the future, the Commiſſions are iſſued out by the Speaker in
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170564:124"/>the Name of the Parliament, and not by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall as formerly.</p>
               <p>Yet the Parliament take ſo much care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their promiſes to them, that they order the immediate ſale of <hi>Whitehall, Hampton</hi>-Court, and <hi>Sommerſet</hi>-Houſe, towards the preſent payment of ſome of the Armyes Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears.</p>
               <p>About this time on the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1659, happened a ſtrange kind of Tumult in or about <hi>Enfield,</hi> ſome part of the Chaſe which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay common, and was the chiefeſt ſtay and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Country people thereabouts, for the feeding of their Catttle, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the chief ſupport and maintenance of themſelves and Families; being by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to ſome of the Souldiers for their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears, was by them built upon, and eucloſed; which ſo incenſed the poor of the Country, whoſe Families were almoſt ready to ſtarve for want of ſuch relief, that notwithſtanding Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were ſent to ſecure thoſe Grounds, the common people made a head, fell upon the Souldiers, took nine of them priſoners, threw down a Barn, and levelled the encloſures.</p>
               <p>The Parliament upon audience given to an extraordinary Ambaſſador of the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> appointed three perſons to go over as Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries to <hi>Coppenhaguen,</hi> to treat of ſuch
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170564:124"/>a reconciliation between the two Kings of <hi>Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi> as might beſt ſtand with the intereſt of <hi>England;</hi> but their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage hath as yet produced no conſiderable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>And now further to ſecure themſelves in thoſe deſignes they had in hand here, they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all Cavaliers, under the ſtile of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, from <hi>London,</hi> and twenty Miles about; and paſs an Act for the ſettlement of the Militia, in the reſpective Cities and Countries of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though this Parliament had taken away the Government of theſe three Nations from <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> yet they are ſo kind to him, as to protect him from all arreſts, and take care for the payment of his Debts, which amounted to 29640<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>; and beſides order him 10000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
                  <hi>per annum</hi> for his life, out of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal hs Lands; as much of which 'tis probable he received, as his Creditors did of what was owing to them.</p>
               <p>And now the Parliament diſcover a female-Plot of the ſhee-Cavaliers, for the ſubverting of their Government; the Lady <hi>Mary How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Barkſhire,</hi> and one M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
                  <hi>Sumner</hi> are committed to the Tower, upon pretence of being pryers to a horrible terrible deſign againſt the Government, upon whoſe
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170564:125"/>Examinations all the Horſes about Town are taken. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Erneſtus Byrom</hi> and others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon.</p>
               <p>But now ſomewhat begins to appear, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Troops of Horſe are ſent into <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> to prevent infurrections there; where they take ſeverall Cavaliers, to bring them up to <hi>London.</hi> Major Generall <hi>Maſſey</hi> being likewiſe in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> endeavouring as it was pretended to raiſe Forces there for the King, was ſurprized by a Troop of Horſe, who for the better ſecuring him, ſet up a Trooper behind him, with whom coming down a Hill, the Horſe ſtumbled and fell, and the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dark, and <hi>Maſſey</hi> nimble legged, eſcaped from them into the Wood.</p>
               <p>The Parliament now begin to diſcover the reaſon of the buying up of ſo many Arms in <hi>London;</hi> for S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booth,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Thomas Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton,</hi> and ſome others of the ſecluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, having got a conſiderable quantity of Arms, raiſed a Party in <hi>Cheſhire, Flintſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> to the number of between three and four thouſand men; and declare <hi>for a Free Parliament, and the due rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Nation, againſt that Fanatick and unlawfull power, which now uſurped domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them.</hi> With theſe they rendezvows at <hi>Routon</hi>-Heath; and from thence march to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170564:125"/>
                  <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> endeavouring to augment their Party; Collonel <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and Governour of the Cattle of <hi>Leverpool,</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them what aid and aſſiſtance he could, though he never performed it.</p>
               <p>This great riſing at firſt ſtartled the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who immediately diſpatch the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> with three Regiments of Horſe, one of Dragoons, and three of Foot, to march with all poſſible haſt to ſuppreſs them; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſeverall Parties which endeavoured to riſe in other Counties, are prevented either by the Militia, or the Parliaments Forces.</p>
               <p>But S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booths</hi> number daily encreaſes ſomewhat, by the confluence of the Gentry of thoſe parts unto him; ſo that he made up a very gallant body of Horſe. He ſends his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Declarations up to <hi>London,</hi> inviting them to joyn with him to maintain their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and redeem themſelves from the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very they were now in: But all proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, that great City being over-awed by a ſmall Party of the Parliaments Forces.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Lambert</hi> makes a ſpeedy march towards them; two Regiments, the one of Horſe, the other of Foot, are by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Parliament ſent out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Command of Collonel <hi>Axtill,</hi> Collonel <hi>Hierom Zankey,</hi> who joyn with <hi>Lambert</hi> neer
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:170564:126"/>
                  <hi>Nantwich,</hi> notwithſtanding ſome endeavours of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booths</hi> Party to hinder their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; and on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my faced one another, the one on one ſide the River, the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Hereupon S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booth</hi> ſends a Trumpet to <hi>Lambert,</hi> to tell him the reaſons of his taking up of Arms; and deſiring, <hi>that to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſhedding of blood, ſome perſons might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to conferre in order to a Treaty.</hi> But <hi>Lambert</hi> returns him a ſhort anſwer; <hi>telling him, that the readieſt way to avoid ſhedding of blood, was for them to lay down their Arms, and ſurrender</hi> Cheſter <hi>and other Strengths; which if they refuſed to do, that he was ſent to reduce them to their due obedience, which by the help of God he did not doubt but to do.</hi> Hereupon the next morning <hi>Lamberts</hi> Army advanced towards <hi>Nantwich</hi>-Bridge, which was kept by a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booths.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Georges</hi> Horſe and Foot were drawn upin Battalia in a Meadow juſt below the Bridge. <hi>Lambert</hi> ſeeing that he could not draw his enemy out of his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, reſolved to beat him out; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon comands a ſtout Party of Foot to aſſault thoſe which kept the Bridge, which they did with a great deal of courage and reſolution, and were as ſtoutly reſiſted on the other ſide, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one gaining the advantage, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170564:126"/>the other; till at length S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booths</hi> Party giving back, made way for all <hi>Lamberts</hi> Army to get over, who immediately fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Georges</hi> Foot, and put them to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, but with little execution, by reaſon of the encloſures, which gave them liberty to make good their retreat from hedge to hedge. The Horſe then on both ſides charged likewiſe with good courage and reſolution, but the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> men being overpoured, turned their backs; and after a quarter of a Miles conſuſed retreat, rallied again, but were preſently rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And ſo both Horſe and Foot betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to flight. The Foot by reaſon of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures made their eſcape; and the Horſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding fled ſome towards <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and others towards <hi>Warrington,</hi> whither they were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by <hi>Lamberts</hi> victorious Cavalry; who notwithſtanding could proceed no further, the Town being garriſoned with four Companies of Foot, and a Troop of Horſe of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Georges</hi> Party.</p>
               <p>In the time of the fight there were left in <hi>Nantwich</hi> two Companies of Foot, and two Troops of Horſe of the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Forces, who were immediately forced to fly towards <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> where they diſſipated themſelves. The grand Body of the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> men being thus broken, the remainder of them quickly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170564:127"/>themſelves; and <hi>Cheſter</hi> it ſelf ſeeing no hopes of relief, ſhould they ſtand out, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves immediately to <hi>Lamberts</hi> mercy, whoſe example all other places like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe followed.</p>
               <p>The number of the ſlain in the late action was not great; but there was ſcarce any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of quality, who either before or after the Fight became not <hi>Lamberts</hi> priſoners. Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> ſeeing all things thus loſt, and himſelf reduced to the extremity of ſaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by flight, left <hi>Cheſter</hi> in diſguiſe, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to come up to <hi>London,</hi> the better to make his eſcape; but by the permiſſion of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, this noble Gentleman (who when all the Nation almoſt was buried in a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh lethargy, did endeavour to rouze them out of their ſleepy ſlavery) was diſcovered at <hi>Newport Paynell</hi> in <hi>Bedfordſhire,</hi> and fell into the power of his mercileſs and tyrannicall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by whom he was committed priſoner to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as they had thus got him into their power, they ſend two of their chiefeſt bloud-Hounds, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Henry Vane</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Arthur Haſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig,</hi> to draw what they could by his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he notwithſtanding their reiterated threats of death and Scaffolds, and the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous report of perfidious friends, and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170564:127"/>enemies, with undaunted courage refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either to excuſe himſelf, or accuſe others by a puſillanimous confeſſion.</p>
               <p>The Parliament being now overjoyed with their ſucceſs, immediately in token of their favour and thankfullneſs, order a thouſand pounds, as a remuneration of <hi>Lamberts</hi> ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſervice, to be immediately ſent him; but he having other deſigns in his head, then tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meerly to the advancement of their intereſt, preſently diſtributes to his Souldiery, with high carouſes for their worthy deſerts of it.</p>
               <p>The attempts which were made in other parts of the Kingdome, to have riſen at the ſame with S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booth,</hi> being all of them nipt in the bud, deſerve nothing elſe but ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Though there were divers worthy and eminent perſons engaged in them, who deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the thanks and praiſe of their Country, for thoſe their willing (though fruitleſs) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
               <p>The Parliament had (whileſt <hi>Lambert</hi> is fighting their enemies) in the mean time ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care for dividing the ſpoil, and prepared an Act for Sequeſtrations, which now they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately paſs, and appoint Commiſſioners for the proſecution of it, by which they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the utter ruining of moſt of the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation, that ſo they might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170564:128"/>them incapable for the future of making head againſt their arbitrary uſurpation. And this Act was to continue to the firſt of <hi>May</hi> 1660, a day which it pleaſed God to ordain to a better uſe, and another manner of terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their tyranny, then theſe notorious Traytors had intended.</p>
               <p>The next thing they do, is to endeavour the extinction of thoſe ſmall ſparks, which ſeemed to remain of the late inſurrection. And to this end they put out a Proclamation againſt <hi>John Mordent</hi> Eſq; Son to the Earl of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> Major Generall <hi>Maſſey,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>William Compton, Thomas Fanſhaw</hi> Eſq; and Major Generall <hi>Brown;</hi> and declared the reward of a hundred pounds, to whomſoever ſhould apprehend any of the ſaid perſons; ſome of which rendered themſelves to the Counſell.</p>
               <p>The Houſe about this time having now loſt the affections of the whole Nation beſides, that they might the better engage the Schiſmaticks, order the releaſe of <hi>James Nailor</hi> out of <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> to the great ſatisfaction of the Quakers and Fanaticks, upon whom they now chiefly relied.</p>
               <p>And now the Parliament thinking the longer keeping up the Militiaes of the Counties, to be both uſeleſs and dangerous, order their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding;
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170564:128"/>which whether it was promoted by ſome friends of <hi>Lamberts</hi> in the Houſe, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncertain; but the conſequence ſhewed it very much conducing to his ſucceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.</p>
               <p>For now <hi>Lambert</hi> having finiſhed his work in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> was advancing towards <hi>London,</hi> but all the way had by Agents under hand ſo tampered with the Army, as might render them ready for his devotion and intereſt. To which purpoſe a Paper is promoted amongſt them, entituled, <hi>The humble Petition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſalls of the Army, under the Command of the Right Honourable the Lord</hi> Lambert, <hi>in the late Northern expedition:</hi> in which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate their deſerts and affection to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and deſire <hi>that the Command of the Army might be under the Command of</hi> Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, <hi>as Captain Generall;</hi> Lambert, <hi>Major Generall,</hi> &amp;c. This was ſent up to <hi>London</hi> to Collonel <hi>Aſhfield, Cobbet,</hi> and Lientenant Collonel <hi>Duckenfield,</hi> to be by them preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and by him to the Houſe. The forementioned perſons acquaint <hi>Fleetwood</hi> with it; and he for the better promoting of it, deſires a Conference with S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Arthur Haſlerig,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> in order to its preſentation to the Parliament; but S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Arthur</hi> immediately informs the Parliament of the Paper (as he
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170564:129"/>ſaid) of moſt dangerous conſequence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they preſently order that the ſaid three perſons, or one of them in whoſe hands it was, ſhould immediately bring in the originall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, which was by one put off to the other, and ſo not to be found amongſt them. But the Officers of the Army immediately meet in Counſell, in order to the drawing up of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of their ſubmiſſion to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſclaiming the ſaid propoſall. The Parliament having thereupon paſſed a Vote, <hi>That the having of more Generall Officers, was a thing needleſs, chargeable, and dangerous to the Commonwealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt the Officers are thus meeting, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in order to their quiet ſubmiſſion to the Parliaments reſolves, the Houſe had ordered a day of Thankſgiving for their <hi>Cheſhire</hi>-victory, on which together with the Counſell of State, and the Officers of the Army, they dined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Counſell at <hi>Grocers</hi>-Hall.</p>
               <p>They now put out an Additionall Act for Sequeſtrations, intending that the ſeverity of their arbitrary juſtice ſhould provide them with rewards for the preſent, and ſecurity for the future.</p>
               <p>And now comes out <hi>the humble Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Petition of the Army;</hi> wherein though
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:170564:129"/>they ſeemingly profeſſed all obedience, yet they tacitly harped upon the former ſtring, and drove at the maintaining their own power, in oppoſition to the Houſes intereſt. This was te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly diſcuſſed in the Houſe, and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exactly ſcanned: ſome of which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament utterly diſliking, as tending to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of their Power; and perceiving the Army ſtill to go on in their clandeſtine deſigns, they reſolve to make proviſion againſt them. And the Army ſeeing their reſolution, proceed vigorouſly likewiſe, though privately, yet they put out the former Repreſentation in Print, and endeavour as much as they could to encreaſe the number of the Subſcribers. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the other ſide, to cut off all hopes as they thought of the Armyes ſubſiſtance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in and by them, and ſo prevent their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, paſs an Act, <hi>that it ſhould be treaſon in all perſons whatſoever, to raiſe, levy, or collect Money without conſent of Parliament; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe make void the Acts for Cuſtome and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize;</hi> that if the Army ſhould proceed in their deſigns, they might be cut off from mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. This being thus ordered, they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vote the Commiſſions of thoſe nine noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Worthies, and ſo infamous Patriots of their Country, and promoters of its good and ſettlement, the contrary way, <hi>viz: Lambert,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170564:130"/>Desborough, Berry, Kelſey, Aſhfield, Cobbet, Creed, Packer, and Barrow,</hi> to be null and void, and diſpoſed their Regiments otherwiſe; and likewiſe order the Government of the Army to be by ſeven Commiſſioners, in whom the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould joyntly reſide; theſe were <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Ludlow,</hi> Generall <hi>Monke, Haſlerig, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Morley,</hi> and <hi>Overton,</hi> thinking hereby to cure this hot diſtemper, and reduce them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
               <p>But whileſt they are thus quick and nimble in their reſolutions, <hi>Lambert</hi> and the reſt of his complices are not behind them in diligence; but having ſtrengthened their Party as much as time would give leave, and drawn as many of the Souldiery as they could from the obedience of the Parliament, reſolve once more to put an end to their ſitting, and rather turn them out of doors, then ſit down quietly with the loſs of their Commiſſions.</p>
               <p>The Parliament having over night notice of what was intended the day following, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven order for the drawing of what Forces were yet faithfull to them to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> in order to the guarding them the next day. Collonel <hi>Moſſes</hi> and Collonel <hi>Morleys</hi> Regiments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately obeyed their Commands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the <hi>Pallace</hi>-yard in the night, and early in the morning; but <hi>Lambert</hi> having
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170564:130"/>gathered the reſt of the Army together, did immediately there ſurround them, ſtopping all the avenues, ſo that there was no hopes of any more aſſiſtance: and whilſt they were thus in oppoſition, the Speaker was by Major <hi>Creed</hi> turned back again, and not ſuffered to paſſe to the Houſe; and at laſt both parties having ſtood almoſt all the day at bay, were on a ſudden reconciled, with mutual reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to advance a <hi>Lambertonian</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lambert</hi> having thus over-maſter'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and diſmiſſed them from their Power and Authority, upon conſultation with his fellow-Worthies, cals a Counſel of Officers, who immediately poſt away Collonel <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Cobbet</hi> for <hi>Scotland,</hi> to winne the Armies there, if poſſible, to a compliance with their actions.</p>
               <p>And that theſe migh be thought Devils, which did believe and tremble, they order a Day of Humiliation, intending to mock God, that they might, according to the cuſtome of their Predeceſſors, with greater eaſe and ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy gull the people.</p>
               <p>They proceed in the next place to the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Army, and make choice of <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> for Captain General, or rather ſtalking-horſe
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:170564:131"/>to <hi>Lamberts</hi> all-commanding power; <hi>Lambert</hi> Major General, and <hi>Disbrow</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary General of the horſe; and appoint a Committee for nomination of Officers, in the rooms of thoſe, who for their taking part with the Parliament againſt them, they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded.</p>
               <p>Having in ſome ſort ſetled their military Power, that they might not be ſeen to do what they really intended, that is, to rule by the Sword alone, they make out a kind of ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oligarchy, or rather Anarchy, in whoſe Power without more ado, they put the Laws, Lives and Liberty of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This they call a Committee of Safety; which, how it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the name, I will leave the Reader to judge, giving him the names of the members thereof, men either of lunatick and crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd principles, as having been all along the grandeſt ringleaders of the Sectaries; or ſuch, whoſe ambitious ſpirits would terminate no where, but in the ſlavery and ruine of their native Countrey, moſt of which was ingaged in the horrid murther of their lawfull Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. But let Poſterity know and deteſt their memory.</p>

               <p>This news extreamly ſtartles our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and make them begin to look about them; and to think what way they might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170564:134"/>peace; but leſt this ſhould prove ineffectual to to reduce him, they had prepared for Warre likewiſe. <hi>Lambert</hi> was already on his march thither, with all the ſtrength of the Army both Horſe and Foot, in ſo numerous a body, that in all probability, had they had to doe with a perſon leſſe wiſe and prudent than this noble General, they would quickly have conſummated their own victory and his, and this Nations ruine.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe upon <hi>Lambert</hi>'s departure, had ordered and choſen new Commiſſioners for the Militia in <hi>London,</hi> picking out ſuch perſons for the moſt part, whoſe ſchiſmatical principles, or elſe former notorious crimes, were like to make them ſtick ſureſt to ſo bad compartners; and into theſe mens pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they put the whole Command of the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lambert</hi> being already advanced North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, coming into <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> doth there joyn with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Brigade, and thoſe forces under the Command of Collonel <hi>Lilburne;</hi> and whilſt every body expected that a ſudden fight would make a deciſion of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie; General <hi>Monck</hi> by extraordinary prudence keeps off at ſwords point with fair words, and as we may truly ſay <hi>pious fraud</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives this ſo grand jugler and deceiver.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:170564:134"/>
               <p>The Commiſſioners of General <hi>Monck,</hi> which we aforementioned, were now arrived at <hi>London,</hi> and by the appointment of the Counſel of Officers, perſons were ordered to treat with them, who after ſeveral debates, brought buſineſſes almoſt to a period, by the fault of Collonel <hi>Wilks,</hi> who tranſcended the bounds of his Commiſſion, and for his pains was upon his return juſtly impriſoned by the General. <hi>By his ſimplicity</hi> I ſay, things were brought to a reſult or agreement, the heads whereof were theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The utter renouncing of</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>or any other claiming from that Family.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Government to be by a Free-State, and not King, ſingle Perſon, or Houſe of Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a godly and learned Miniſtry be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and encouraged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities to be reformed and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, ſo as to become the Nurſeries of Piety and Learning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Officers and Souldiers, and other Perſons on either ſide be indemnified for what is paſt, touching their late differences, and that all unkindneſſes betwixt them be buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Officers priſoners in</hi> Scotland <hi>to be ſet at liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:170564:135"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Armies on both ſides preſently to depart to their reſpective Quarters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, <hi>That there be a Committee of nineteen, conſiſting of five perſons for</hi> England, <hi>and five for</hi> Scotland <hi>(not Members of the Army) and three for</hi> England, <hi>three for</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and three for</hi> Ireland; <hi>all of which, except one, are Members of the Army; and of theſe nineteen nine ſhall be a Quorum, and are to meet to determine and conclude what is neceſſary for the Qualifications of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is part of that Agreement which was pretended to be made between the Army here, and the Commiſſioners of the Lord General <hi>Monck,</hi> which becauſe it did prove vain and abortive, deſerves no further particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>About this time ſeveral deſigns of the Rump to reſtore themſelves to their former power, began to be glimmeringly perceived. Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Morley,</hi> and ſeveral other Officers of the Army making proteſts againſt the preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
               <p>But the Committee of Safety perceiving the danger their new Government was in of being ſtifled in the birth, and finding City and Countrey to be generally diſaffected with them, except thoſe who were of ſchiſmatical
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:170564:135"/>principles, do order Commiſſions to be iſſued out for raiſing ſeveral Foot-Regiments of theſe throughout the Nation, under the notion of the well-affected. And that they might ſeem to have conquered ſome difficulties, they daily by their Pamphleteer, publiſh the beſt of their own Condition, and produce Letters from <hi>Ireland</hi> of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1659. wherein they declare <hi>the Armies in</hi> Ireland <hi>non-approbation of the actions of General</hi> Monck, <hi>and their free concurrence with their Brethren in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But as this was only a pretence from ſome perſons there equally intereſſed with themſelves in the late irregular actions, ſo did it ſuddenly after vaniſh into nothing; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality there under Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Waller</hi> perfectly declaring for their enemies the Rump.</p>
               <p>But here I muſt make ſome ſhort digreſſion. For this Moneth it pleaſed God that that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of men, and unparallel'd murtherer <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw</hi> died in his bed; a man whom I need not much defile my pen to ſet forth, ſince that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry name doth now, and will to eternity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, all that is matter of ſhame and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; and yet it pleaſed the wiſe God to ſuffer him on the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this <hi>November,</hi> to be laid quietly in his grave; who may, according to the judgement of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170564:136"/>ſome men have deſerved better to be buried alive in the entrails of dogs, then to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the benefit of Chriſtian Funerals; but we are not to cenſure the pleaſure of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>On the 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this Moneth <hi>Lambert</hi> arrived at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> where he found ſeveral diſcard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Officers to be come from General <hi>Monck,</hi> which though they cried up at <hi>London,</hi> as a weakning of his party, yet they found it by experience to be a wiſe ſtrengthning of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, by ridding himſelf of thoſe, which he knew neither could, nor would be true to any ſober deſigns.</p>
               <p>Now were Letters from General <hi>Monck,</hi> ſent to the Common Counſel of <hi>London,</hi> and delivered to them by Collonel <hi>Markham,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Atkin,</hi> which containing things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in oppoſition to what the Committee of Safety had flattered their party and the people withall, were by them given out to be forged, and thereupon they ordered the confinement of the two fore-mentioned perſons.</p>
               <p>But in this interim the Parliament (which as I ſaid before the General had ſummoned) in <hi>Scotland</hi> were aſſembled, to whom he delivers his ſentiments of the preſent poſture of affairs, which terminated in theſe three Propoſitions.</p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:170564:136"/>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That he having a call from God and man, to march into</hi> England <hi>for reſetling the Parliament, they would, during his abſence, which would not be long, preſerve the peace of that Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That if any troubles ſhould ariſe, they would aſſiſt him in ſuppreſſing them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That they would raiſe him ſome money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which Propoſitions the ſumme of their anſwers, was briefly thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That they could not engage to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Peace of the Countrey, wanting Armes, but ſhould notwithſtanding uſe their endeavours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They were incapable to anſwer his deſires; and beſides thought it imprudent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, to ingage in a Warre, whereof the ſucceſſe was dubious, and the advantage to them uncertain, and not intelligible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>They were content to levy him twelve moneths aſſeſſement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though in the two firſt they did not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate their anſwer to the affirmative of his Propoſitions, yet in this laſt (I ſuppoſe) they ſatisfied the whole of his intentions, it being that which he chiefly ſtood in need of, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the great work he had in hand.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170564:137"/>whilſt Gen. <hi>Monck</hi> is thus vigorouſly providing againſt them in the North, they are not leſſe violently attached, by diſcontents of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>London,</hi> and open force more South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. At <hi>London</hi> the Apprentices, whoſe tumultuary Aſſemblies, and confuſed Petitions had been inſtrumental to the firſt diſturbances, 1640. begin now to recollect their ſpirits, and (as was thought) abetted by ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable perſons, reſolve to petition the Heads of the City, to endeavour the reſtitution of them, and the whole Nation to their due Rights and Priviledges by a Free Parliament. The noiſe of this extreamly ſtartles the Army and Committee of Safety; ſo that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour all means of prevention; and to this purpoſe they publiſh a Proclamation againſt it, and ſend their forces into the City, on the day whereon they heard it was reſolved to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Common Counſel; where not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the violence, and other high miſdemeanours committed by <hi>Hewſon</hi> the Commander of the Souldiers, yet the Petition was by ſix noble ſpirited Apprentices preſented to the Common Counſel, and the thanks of it returned to them for it.</p>
               <p>Several other Petitions and endeavours were promoted likewiſe in order for a Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not was the Deſigners for the Rump
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170564:137"/>leſſe active, but ſate daily in conſultation for the undermining the preſent Uſurpers, but their deſigns in <hi>London</hi> came to no head; but on the fifth of <hi>December</hi> news arrived of the appearance of the grand Heads of them at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> whether <hi>Morley</hi> and <hi>Haſilrig</hi> were arrived; and the Governour Collonel <hi>Whetham</hi> ſided with them, and immediately ſecured Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> Captain <hi>Peacocke,</hi> and ſuch other Officers of the Gariſon, as they knew were principled contradictorily to that intereſt. Theſe in power here, though they had little hopes to cope with ſo many adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, yet immediately order a Body of Horſe and Foot that way, if poſſible, to blow the ſtorm over, and reduce that revolting Gariſon.</p>
               <p>Major <hi>Cadwell</hi> was the firſt that with a party of Horſe marched towards them; but he was no ſooner going that way, but part of his Forces deſert him, and took part with the contrary faction.</p>
               <p>But this was not all the miſery that attended them; they had an enemy nearer home to deal withall, the City was to the height diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and having recovered ſome part of its former vigour, reſolved no longer to be fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Common Counſel met daily, and their reſults produced nothing but was hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170564:138"/>to the Army intereſt, who finding all their threats and force to be now of no effect, reſolve to ſee what they can do by treaty, and whither or no they could ſtill theſe neighbour ſtorms by fair and gilded promiſes. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Counſel elected a Committee of worthy and eminent Citizens to conferre with them, eſteeming them not worthy any other owning, or any way deſerving the acknowledgement of an Authority. With theſe <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and the reſt of the Grandees had a conference, and that they might to the vulgar give them ſome ſeeming ſatisfaction, they are willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Parliament ſhall be called and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſit down at or before the firſt of</hi> February <hi>next.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſaid Parliament ſhall be according to ſuch qualifications as are, or ſhould be agreed upon, and may beſt ſecure the juſt Rights, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Priviledges both Civil and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious of the people of this Commonwealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This they thought enough to ſtop the mouth of the City for the preſent, intending what performance or after-termes themſelves plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but their endeavours remained fruitleſſe, the City keeping ſtill the ſame face of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.</p>
               <p>But upon the neck of this news, comes ſtill
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170564:138"/>of ſeverall endeavours for inſurrections againſt them, in defence of the Rump. In <hi>Suſſex</hi> a Party had been formed under one Collonel <hi>Fiſſenden,</hi> which notwithſtanding were diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and Collonel <hi>Fagg</hi> likewiſe, who was raiſing Forces, with intentions to ſtrengthen the Party at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> was taken and brought up to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But their <hi>Portſmouth</hi> enemies grew daily ſtronger and ſtronger. Major <hi>Bremen,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of Collonel <hi>Rich</hi> his Regiment, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall others, inſtead of reſiſting them, going in to their aſſiſtance, and ſo adding daily to their number.</p>
               <p>And at this time was a deſign framed to have ſeized on the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> for the behalf of the late Peer of a Parliament, which was thus to have taken effect. The deſigners ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought over Collonel <hi>Fitch</hi> to their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and engaged him to the promotion of the enterprize, he was on Munday the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> about eight in the Morning, to have come out of the Tower in his Coach, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning about ten, to have carried in with him in the Coach Collonel <hi>Okey,</hi> Major <hi>Wagſtaffe,</hi> and <hi>John Streater,</hi> late Comptrollers of the Armies train of Artillery; and immediately after the Coach were four Companies of Foot, ready prepared for that purpoſe, amongſt the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:170564:139"/>Sectaries in <hi>London</hi> to have ruſhed in, upon Pretence of Orders from <hi>Fleetwood</hi> for ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Garriſon; and ſo bing entred, to declare immediately for the late diſturbed Rump. But this deſign of theirs was not ſo privately carried, but that it was diſcovered to thoſe at <hi>Wallingford</hi>-Houſe, who on the Sunday before ſending for <hi>Fitch,</hi> did there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him, and forthwith <hi>Deſborough</hi> and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Salmon</hi> to take care of the ſecurity of the Tower; and ſo this machination vaniſhed into nothing.</p>
               <p>But now the Generall Counſell of Officers ſit daily, that they might conclude ſomething concerning the <hi>mock-Parliament</hi> they intended, which they reſolved ſhould have nothing of a Parliament but the name, being to be curbed and kept under by the negative voice of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ridiculous and ſchiſmaticall perſons of their own faction, whom they termed <hi>Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators,</hi> and were in number twenty one.</p>
               <p>On the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> they publiſh the Proclamation for this their Parliament, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Writs ſhould immediately go forth, as ſoon as they had conſidered what number it ſhould conſiſt of, and what perſons for beſt conducement to themſelves.</p>
               <p>On the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> comes news far worſe then all the reſt, they are now like to be forceably ſet
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:170564:139"/>upon at their own doors; <hi>Lawſon</hi> with a ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Ships comes into the River, and makes proteſtation againſt them and their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, reſolving the reſtoration of the late pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Parliament. To remedy this if poſſible, they ſend down with all ſpeed S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> Major <hi>Saloway,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Salmon,</hi> to treat with him, who were no ſooner come aboard, but they find with him S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Anthony Aſhly Coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Scot,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Streater,</hi> three of the Rumps great Agents; ſo that inſtead of a friendly complyance, this conference ended in nothing but taunts of theſe Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Nor was <hi>London</hi> and the adjacent places in this <hi>interim,</hi> free from deſigns againſt them; a plot was formed generally over the City, to have made a generall inſurrection in vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their liberties; but this being (as was ſuppoſed) diſcovered by ſome of the chief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers, was broken, and ſeverall perſons taken and ſecured for it, both at <hi>London</hi> and at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where a Party was likewiſe to be formed to ſecond theſe.</p>
               <p>The Common-Counſell of <hi>London</hi> ſeeing theſe ſtrange diſtractions and tumults which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day happened, and knowing of how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence they were to the welfare of the City, which by theſe means might be made the ſeat of War, reſolved to take the liberty to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170564:140"/>themſelves, ſince they were abſolutely denied it, of ſetling their own Militia in ſuch hands, as they might confide in for the ſafeguard of it; and accordingly made choiſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Officers, which was ſince preſented to the Rump, but denied, though afterwards confirmed upon the re-admiſſion of the ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Members.</p>
               <p>But now comes the period of this Embryo of a Government; for meſſengers coming hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bring news of the advance of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Arthur Haſlerig,</hi> and the reſt from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>London.</hi> Whereupon the Officers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves begin to be various and uncertain in their ridiculous determinations, concluding on one thing, and then reſolving the contrary, and the Souldiers perceiving how unable they were to help themſelves, reſolve to provide for their own ſecurity, and leave their Officers to ſhift for themſelves. Upon the Summons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and Orders of the Rumps Agents here in Town, they muſter themſelves in <hi>Lincolns Inn</hi>-field, under the Command of Collonel <hi>Okey,</hi> Collonel <hi>Alured,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Markham,</hi> and there with ſhouts teſtifie their reſolutions to return to the obedience of the Parliament; and ſo from thence marching into <hi>Chancery</hi>-Lane, and by the Speakers door, they all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to his command, as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Souldiers.</p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:170564:140"/>
               <p>That night the Speaker accompanied with divers others, comes into the City, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints the Maior and Sheriffs of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments intentions to ſit again very ſhortly; and therefore deſires him to endeavour, that ſeeing they were again reſtored to the exerciſe of the Government, he would endeavour to ſtill and quiet the animoſities of the City, that they might acquieſce and ſubmit to their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. From thence he goes to the Tower, and having diſtributed twenty pounds amongſt the Souldiery, commits the charge of it to Sir <hi>Anthony Aſhly Cooper,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Weaver,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Joſias Barnars,</hi> who were confirmed a while after by the Parliament, with addition of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Scot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no ſooner were things thus overturned at <hi>London,</hi> but news comes likewiſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of the Army-faction in <hi>Ireland;</hi> Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> and other his aſſociates, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring publikely in behalf of the Rump, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving impriſoned Collonel <hi>Jones,</hi> and the reſt of his Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſborows</hi> Regiment had advanced out of the North from <hi>Lambert,</hi> in order to help to quiet their diſturbances here, but the work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done before they came, their labour was loſt; and ſo they thought it better to ſubmit to the mercy of the Parliament, then by ſtanding
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170564:141"/>out in defence of their Collonel, to hazard both their lives and Arrears.</p>
               <p>Munday <hi>December</hi> the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> was the day of the Rumps re-inſtallment, and finall perdition of the late imaginary Government, the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Embryo of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Henry Vane;</hi> but it's hard to ſay, <hi>whether</hi> England <hi>had not as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſorry for the reſtoration of the one, as for the deſtruction of the other,</hi> ſince both of them made it their aim and intereſt to inſlave and oppreſs their native Country. But the Rump being thus reſeated, conferre without delay the Government of the Army upon Collonel <hi>Alexander Popham,</hi> Collonel <hi>Thompſon,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Scot,</hi> Collonel <hi>Okey,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Anthony Aſhly Cooper,</hi> Collonel <hi>Alured,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who, or any three of them, were to be Commiſſioners for that end and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>They next take into conſideration the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Moneys, and order the continuance of Cuſtome and Exciſe: For though they had voted it down as oppreſſive to the Nation, that they might thereby deprive the Army of the benefit of it; yet were they reſolved they would not themſelves loſe the profit, though never ſo much to the prejudice of the people; it being envy and not good will, which made them formerly vote it down.</p>
               <p>That they might likewiſe ſeem to give ſome
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:170564:141"/>ſatisfaction to the deſires of the Nation, they appoint a Committee to conſider of the caſes of abſent Members, and filling up of the Houſe; a thing they would never have done, had not Generall <hi>Monck</hi> ſo nobly forced them to it.</p>
               <p>But next that they might diſſipate the grand enemy which they had in the North, to wit <hi>Lambert,</hi> they order, <hi>Firſt the diſbanding of all ſuch Forces, as had been raiſed without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament. Secondly the returning of all Arms which had been taken out of the publike ſtores. Thirdly that all the Regiments of Horſe and Foot in the Northern Counties, do forthwith repair unto ſuch Quarters, as ſhall be appointed for them by the Commiſſioners for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Army, and obſerve their order inddirections for time to come. And then they ordered thanks to be returned to Generall</hi> Monck, <hi>Vice-Admirall</hi> Lawſon, <hi>and the</hi> Portſmouth <hi>Commiſſioners, as an acknowledgement of their fidelity and good ſervice. And this was their firſt Act, upon their reſetling their Rump in its former ſeat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divers were the other Votes and Orders which they made, for ſetling their Army, and ſecuring their power, which becauſe not much materiall for our purpoſe, we ſhall paſs on to what is more properly hiſtoricall; namely the actions of Generall <hi>Moncke,</hi> and his march
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170564:142"/>towards <hi>London;</hi> yet not forgetting ſuch things, as in the mean time paſſed at <hi>London</hi> or elſewhere, and ought to be conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Generall <hi>Monck</hi> had after his firſt Treaty at <hi>London</hi> by his Commiſſioners, and that he might keep things from running to bloodſhed, and prevent the hazard of a Battle, knowing that time it ſelf muſt certainly make him victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, upon notice of the agreement made by his Commiſſioners here, contrary to the tenor of their Commiſſions, or his intentions; had I ſay agreed upon a ſecond Treaty to be had at <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> By which means he delayed time ſo long, that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Arthur Haſlerig</hi> and the reſt, making that diverſion at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was on a ſuddain reſtored, and his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies immediately upon news vaniſhed like ſmoke, all the Forces being by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Order to ſubmit to his command and diſpoſure. Having therefore ſetled all things according to his pleaſure, and as was moſt convenient to his purpoſe, he reſolves upon his march to <hi>London,</hi> and for that purpoſe took up Horſes in the Country to horſe his Foot, the Parliament approving of his actions, for fear to diſpleaſe him, though they had ordered his coming up only with 500 Horſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Army in their reſpective Quarters. But he who was to do other things then barely
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170564:142"/>the reſtoring of a putrified Rump, reſolves to march up with his whole ſtrength; but in the mean time lulls them aſleep with a ſmiling complyance with their humors and deſires. His march towards <hi>London</hi> was but ſlow, he being reſolved to keep his Army in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as might provide ſecurity for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, and teſtifie the prudence of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. In <hi>Yorkeſhre</hi> he was met by the Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi> and other Gentlemen of the County, (who before <hi>Lamberts</hi> diſperſing, had raiſed a conſiderable Body, and with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Brigade had ſecured <hi>Yorke</hi>) and by them was careſſed with all teſtimonies of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and courted with their deſires that he would be inſtrumentall to make the Nation happy, by <hi>reſtoring the Members ſecluded in</hi> 1648, <hi>or in helping them to a full and free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. This likewiſe was the ſubſtance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Declarations, which at this time were ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the Speaker and City of</hi> London <hi>from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Counties. And this likewiſe was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of thoſe other addreſſes, which he received from the Gentry of all places in his march.</hi> But the Parliament a little alarmed by this news, and ſenſible of the danger was thereby immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to themſelves, ſhould the intentions of the Generall be otherwiſe then they ſeemed to them, order M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Scot</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Robinſon</hi> to go
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:170564:143"/>down to him, under pretence of congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him for his ſignall ſervices; but indeed to ſearch if they could into the depth of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But he who was too wiſe to be caught by ſuch gulls, carried himſelf with ſuch an even poiſe, that both Parliament and Country thought him ſurely inclining to their ſeverall Parties. And notable was his Letter, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to one the City had lately ſent him by their Swordbearer; in which he <hi>both reſolved as he ſaid to ſatisfie their deſires for a Free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and yet reſolved to continue faithfull to this Parliament, giving the City matter of hope, and taking from the Rump all cauſe of diſcontent.</hi> But the Parliament having ſent perſons to ſearch into his thoughts, the City likewiſe whom it as nearly concerned, were reſolved to do the like; and therefore made choiſe of Alderman <hi>Fowke,</hi> Alderman <hi>Vincent,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Bromfield,</hi> to go down and preſent him with their affections and deſires, together with their reſolution to ſtick by their former reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who were received by the Generall with all expreſſions of civility; but nothing was promiſed to them, which might give the Rump any ſuſpition or jealouſie of his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. After a long and tedious march on <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 28. 1659. he arrived at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Albans,</hi> where he was preſented with the Addreſſes of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170564:143"/>ſeverall Counties, together with one from the City of <hi>London;</hi> all which containing the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſubject received from him the like courteous, though dubious anſwers. The ſame day he arrived at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Albans,</hi> his Lady ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and took up thoſe lodgings, which had been prepared for her. On Friday <hi>February</hi> the third he arrived at <hi>London,</hi> the Army which was quartered there, having mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out the night before, though with a great deal of diſcontent, and ſome diſorder and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny. He was the next day by the Parliament deſired to come to the Houſe, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Scot</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Robinſon</hi> ſent to attend him; where being come, the Speaker in the higheſt expreſſions might be, did endeavour to teſtifie the grand eſteem the Houſe had of his merits, and the hearty thanks they did return to him for them; and he afterwards retaliated his language, in an excellent ſpeech, whereof though in all things he ſeemed to comply with their deſires, yet in ſome ſort he put them in mind of the peoples deſires and inclinations, which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he left to their determination, and upon parting left them well ſatisfied with him, in all outward appearance.</p>
               <p>There were not many things remarkable which fell out at <hi>London</hi> or elſewhere, in the <hi>interim</hi> of the Generalls march thither, only
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170564:144"/>the ejection of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> and Major <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi> (who had been inſtruments in the late interruption) out of the Houſe, and confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the firſt, with <hi>Lambert,</hi> and the reſt of the nine Worthies, to their ſeverall Houſes, and the committing the laſt to the Tower.</p>
               <p>There happened likewiſe two mutinies, the one at <hi>Graveſend</hi> by the Souldiers of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Brice Cockrains</hi> Regiment; and the other at <hi>Briſtoll</hi> by the inhabitants, in relation to a <hi>Free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi> but both were ſunddenly quelled.</p>
               <p>The Generall being as aforeſaid come to <hi>London,</hi> the Parliament, <hi>alias</hi> Rump, (for by that name they may be beſt known,) being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary jealous of him, and the power he might at pleaſure exerciſe over them to their prejudice, conſult amongſt the grandees of them, how they might beſt abridge his power, and overtop him; and for this they deſigned this expedient. The City continuing as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore malecontent, and denying to pay any Money without the conſent of a full Parliament, and refuſing to be ſatisfied with any thing could proceed from the Rump, whoſe villanies were now grown execrable to them, and his ſtrength likewiſe chiefly conſiſting in the affection and intereſt he had in the hearts of the Citizens; they reſolve to kill two Birds with one ſtone, undoe the City, and make him the inſtrument
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170564:144"/>of the action. On <hi>February</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> they ſend him with part of his Army into the City; and he according to their Order marched in that day, and took up his Quarters at the three Tuns at <hi>Guild</hi>-Hall gate, where he was careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſaluted by divers principall Citizens. But he who knew times were not yet ripe for his after comfortable actions, granted them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſends up to the Houſe to know what he ſhould do; who immediately return him theſe Votes for an anſwer, <hi>That he ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medihtely pull down and deſtroy the Gates, Poſts, Chains, and Portculliſes;</hi> which accordingly he put in execution. And moreover ſent theſe following perſons, who had lately been very active for the intereſt of the City, to take up their lodgings in the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> viz. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>alias</hi> Alderman <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> Grocer, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Daniel Spencer,</hi> Collonel <hi>Bromfield,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Richard Foord,</hi> Major <hi>Cox,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Bludworth,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Penning, and</hi> Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Jackson;</hi> all of them Common Counſell men, and perſons of higheſt repute and deſert.</p>
               <p>Theſe actions of his exceedingly ſtartled the faith of all men, who had grounded the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in themſelves, that God had appointed him for the onely inſtrument of his Countreys deliverance, and were now in ſuch a maze, that they almoſt gave over the good hopes
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170564:145"/>they had conceived of him. But he who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood well enough what he went about, and knew that by this action he ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtand, whether the <hi>City</hi> would not be wavering and inconſtant, ſhould he make a neerer conjunction with them, which muſt have ruined him and his good purpoſes together, did fullfill this execrable Command of the Rump, that ſo he might ſet them and the <hi>City</hi> at the utmoſt variance, and ſo make them ſurer and faſter for an after compliance with him, which he not many hours after did make with them, and ſo plenarily ſatisfied the longing deſires of the <hi>City,</hi> and deceived the <hi>Parliament</hi> with their own ſnare. For that they had perfectly deſigned this action to caſt dirt in his face in the eyes of the <hi>City,</hi> may be ſeen, in that whilſt he was about this hatefull drudgery, they already fell to abridge his power, by joyning ſeveral others, as <hi>Heſilrig, Walton, Morley,</hi> &amp;c. in Commiſſion with him for the Government of the Army, that ſo they might reſtrain and curb him at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But he, who underſtood them well enough, had no ſooner finiſhed this dirty work, but upon his return to <hi>White-hall,</hi> he ſends them a Letter, which rang another peal than they expected after their City-Victory, wherein he notably expoſtulated with them
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170564:145"/>for their laſt injurious commands, tels them, <hi>Of their countenancing and abetting ſuch as they had ſeemingly declared enemies, and had been the occaſion of their laſt overthrow, which were then in Town hatching deſignes for the ruine of all. And then concludes with a prefixed time, by which they would reſolve to iſſue out Writs for a new Parliament, that ſo they might terminate their ſitting, and come to a diſſolution, which both Army and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on longingly expected.</hi> After this Letter, he ſent on <hi>Saturday,</hi> Febr. 11. in the morning, and forthwith he gives order for his Army both Foot and Horſe to be in a readineſs, and with them he marches by the backſide of the Town into <hi>Finsbury-field,</hi> where he muſters them, and goes himſelf with ſeveral of his Officers to Dinner with the Lord Maior at his houſe; at night he marched them into the City, where Quarters were provided for them, with the hearty good will of the Citizens, whoſe Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires and Bels did in ſome meaſure teſtifie the unmeaſurable joy they had conceived, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got ſo noble a Gueſt.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not omit one paſſage in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which was the deteſtation of that damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and helliſh Petition which was preſented to the Rump by <hi>Praiſe-God Barebones,</hi> contrived by themſelves, and pretended to come from
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170564:146"/>many thouſand well-affected Brethren in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Weſtminſter,</hi> and the places adjacent, <hi>Wherein they bitterly rail againſt King, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Clergie, caſting all the ſcandal poſſible upon thoſe worthy perſons, who were by armed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence excluded in</hi> 1648. <hi>becauſe by a Treaty with the King, they would have compoſed the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing differences of the Nation: and likewiſe they utterly cried out againſt the reſtoring thoſe Members, or bringing in a Free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as that which muſt inevitably ruine the godly of the Land. For prevention of which they deſired no more than the bare ruine both of Church and State, in theſe following particulars. That no man might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into any place or function, either in Church or State, but who would abſolutely abjure and renounce the King, and all his Family, and any ſingle Perſon whatſoever.</hi> By this means intending the overthrow of that ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Magiſtracy and Miniſtry they had left us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whoſoever in Parliament, or elſwhere ſhould make any mention of reſtoring the King, ſhould be adjudged guilty of High-Treaſon.</hi> Intending hereby to cut off the hands, and ſtop the mouths of thoſe, who had not ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious reſolution for their Countreys ruine, as themſelves.
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:170564:146"/>And yet notwithſtanding this curſed Petition, contained things in it thus horrid and villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, their Rumpſhips was graciouſly pleaſed, to think it deſerved the thanks of the Houſe, which by Order the Speaker returned to them.</p>
               <p>But this our <hi>Noble General</hi> makes one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſo ſudden deſertion of them; and happy was that action of his for <hi>London.</hi> For the Rump (as was reported and believed) had deſigned the utter overthrow of the <hi>City-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> by taking away both <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Common Counſel, and hanging up divers of the moſt eminent, both Aldermen and Commoners.</hi> But when now they ſee their pregnant hopes of compaſſing their miſchievous ends prevented, they ſeem to approve of <hi>General Moncks</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that they might leave no ſtone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, which might ſerve for ſome ſupport to their now falling intereſt: They return hearty thanks to the <hi>Lord Maior</hi> for his good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them; hoping thereby to create ſuch ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities between the City and him, that might render him uncapable of doing them a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, by the affection of the Populacy to him. They had likewiſe deſigned a new <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> made wholly of factious and mechanick perſons, who ſhould have exerciſed what ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny they pleaſed over the City: But bleſſed
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170564:147"/>be God, theſe their machinations were bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the care and wiſdome of our <hi>thrice no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble General.</hi> But to content him, if poſſible, they order a Committee to conſider what Lands were fitting to be conferred upon him; and to ſatisfie him in one particular, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be publiſhed againſt <hi>John Lambert,</hi> wherein he was required to render himſelf within four dayes, upon the forfeiture of his Eſtate. And then as for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parliament,</hi> they make ſhow, to reſolve a ſpeedy ſending out Writs, but reſolve to tie up their hands to their blocks, by previous engagements againſt <hi>King, Houſe of Lords,</hi> &amp;c. But this was no ſatisfaction to the <hi>General.</hi> For he having taken away thoſe arms which were in the hands of the Fanaticks, and ſuch as might have cauſed diſturbance in the City, on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> (a day not to be forgotten, as long as <hi>England</hi> endureth, being the firſt light which glimmered ſome chearfulneſſe to us) having drawn his Army together, he marched to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> early in the morning; and having before-hand prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſecluded Members to be ready, who were then very many of them in Town, and had had divers private meetings; he met them at <hi>White-hall,</hi> where having recommended to them the care of the National intereſt, yet
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170564:147"/>in ſuch termes as the Rump might not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deſpair, he ſaw them admitted into the <hi>Parliament Houſe,</hi> to the great grief and amazement of the former Houſe-keepers, who look upon theſe as Intruders. That night there was Bonfires, and great rejoycing in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the ſecluded Members being in, they fall to their work in good earneſt; they had not ſuch by-ends, or corrupted intereſts to drive on, as their Predeceſſors; and therefore found no ſuch haltings in doing things, which the Nation required. But in the firſt place they order the releaſe of thoſe priſoners, which for Free-Parliament-Petitions had been lately clapt up, as likewiſe the Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Counſel of <hi>London.</hi> They diſanull the <hi>Militia</hi> which the Rump had inſtituted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting only of perſons both Fanatick and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious, and order a new <hi>Militia</hi> throughout all <hi>England,</hi> wherein they nominated the moſt principal of the Gentry, who were thought moſt willing and ready to promote the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Countrey; yet with this proviſo, that they ſhould ſubſcribe that they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the war was lawfull againſt his late Majeſty till 1648. the Parliament by violent force was broken. And that they might be furniſhed with that which is the ſinews and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170564:148"/>ſtrength of all, money, they ſend to the City to deſire them advance ſome money before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand upon ſecurity of the next ſix Moneths aſſeſſement, which was freely granted by the City, and 27000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>. immediately lent them. Whereupon the <hi>City</hi> petition for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſently ſetled according to their deſires.</p>
               <p>The next work they did, was to chuſe a Counſel of State, which was done by lot (of all manner of choiſe the moſt equal, by reaſon no man can find himſelf aggrieved, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who is <hi>pro,</hi> or who is <hi>con</hi>) which prevents all rancour and animoſity. The perſons which were by them choſen, being for the moſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of eminent worth, and ſuch as have to the height teſtified their abilities for the good of their Countrey in this laſt emergency; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were ſome Rumpers amongſt them. I have thought it not amiſſe to give you a Catalogue of them, that we may pay due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to their names and memory.</p>

               <p>Then they repealed ſuch Acts of the Rump, as they had made meerly for the ſatisfaction of their own ſelf ends, and were exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the intereſt of the Kingdome; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off thoſe Sequeſtrations which they had laid on S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booth,</hi> and his party, which muſt have proved almoſt a general calamity to the Nation: and they likewiſe releaſed them from that confinement which they had for a long time lain under. Making moreover ſuch acts as might beſt ſecure the intereſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and conduce to the ſettlement of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170564:149"/>ſome of which were directed to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away all places of power or profit, out of the hands of the Fanatick or Commonwealth party, and putting in thoſe who were like to prove better Patriots. But theſe acts being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry numerous, I think not convenient to inſert the particulars.</p>
               <p>In the next place they commiſſionate the Lord <hi>Monck</hi> to be <hi>Captain General of all the Forces in England, Scotland and Ireland,</hi> a place of the higheſt honour, and which he had as highly deſerved. And now to ſhow that God was pleaſed, notwithſtanding the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſinnes of the Nations to remit his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand: no ſooner were the Members ſeated in the Houſe, but news came that <hi>Ireland</hi> was by his good providence, through the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Charles Coote</hi> already put in ſuch a poſture, as might make it capable of receiving the firſt ſtate of affaires; he having ſecured S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hardreſſe Waller,</hi> and others of the Rumps faction.</p>
               <p>But now ſome ſigne of diſcontent appeared in the Army here, which had formerly been under <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> and <hi>Lamberts</hi> command. For Collonel <hi>Rich</hi>'s Regiment upon news of this change at <hi>London,</hi> began to mutany at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Edmondsbury;</hi> but the Parliament hearing of it, inſtantly ſent out Collonel <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi> a
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170564:149"/>Lover of his Countrey, their former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, with a party of Horſe, to whom upon his approach they quietly ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The Parliament now reſtored the Charter to the City of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> which had been taken away by the Rump upon S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booths</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; as ſhortly afterward they likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the <hi>Dutchy of Lancaſter,</hi> which had been voted down by the others, and made S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Gilbert Gerrard</hi> Chancellour, <hi>Nich. Letch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi> Attorney of the <hi>Dutchy;</hi> and the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>William Lenthal</hi> Eſquire, Chamberlain of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And perceiving that endeavours were daily uſed to ſow ſedition in the <hi>Army,</hi> and that there was deſigns on foot to draw them together to a mutiny, they order, <hi>That none either Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or Souldiers ſhould depart from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Quarters without leave from the Lord General, and thoſe that had, forthwith to return to their aſſigned ſtations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To gratifie D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Claerges,</hi> and in him his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord General, the <hi>Hamper-Office,</hi> a place of good profit was conferred upon him.</p>

                  <hi>Febr.</hi> 29. Upon notice of ſome deſign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving by the Fanatick party, ſeveral armes were ſeiſed in divers places of the City of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:170564:150"/>
                  <hi>London,</hi> and Captain <hi>Kiffen</hi> a grand Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of the Anabaptiſts, and ſeveral others were ſecured, though afterwards releaſed, no matter of weight being then found againſt them.</p>
               <p>And now that they might teſtifie to the world they were other men than their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, who would have continued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a <hi>Parliament</hi> to poſterity, they order their diſſolution to be on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> reſolving before that time to take order for ſummoning a <hi>New Repreſentative.</hi> They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> formerly made by the Aſſembly of Divines, and enacted, <hi>That it ſhould be the Confeſſion of Faith of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>except onely the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth and one and thirtieth Articles concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church-cenſure and Synods.</hi> They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſtitute General <hi>Monck,</hi> together with General <hi>Montague</hi> to be Generals at Sea for the next Summers expedition, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly command <hi>Montague</hi> to go to Sea with all poſſible ſpeed.</p>
               <p>And becauſe ſeveral Members had impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt them, and upon that ſcore were ſecluded the Houſe, they diſanull thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments, and re-admit them, as namely M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               </p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>Deanry of Chriſt-Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:170564:150"/>which had for a long time been in the hands of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Owen</hi> (a man look'd upon at <hi>Oxford</hi> as a hair-brain'd ſchiſmatick) was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, and confirmed to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Reynolds,</hi> a man who farre better deſerved it. They likewiſe at the beginning of <hi>March</hi> releaſed the Lord <hi>Lindſey,</hi> the Lord <hi>Sinclare,</hi> and Lord <hi>Lauderdale</hi> from their tedious impriſonments, to which upon various pretences they had been committed.</p>
               <p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Walker</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Turner</hi> were made Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Admiralty, and Probate of Wils, and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wiſeman</hi> conſtituted the Commonwealths Advocate.</p>
               <p>And now was the Lord General invited to Dinner by the Company of <hi>Mercers,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by ſeveral other of the Companies, the Citizens ſtriving mutually, who ſhould in the beſt manner diſcover and expreſſe the gratefulneſs and eſteem they bore for his noble and heroick actions.</p>
               <p>At this time there was an aſſembly of a <hi>Parliamentary Convention</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Broghill,</hi> for the better Regulating of affairs there, till all things in <hi>England</hi> might be in a better poſture.</p>
               <p>The Parliament that they might teſtifie to the world, that they were not ſo forgetfull of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:170564:151"/>Oaths as their fellow-Members, order the <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant</hi> to be ſet up and read in all Churches; and likewiſe to be ſet up in the Parliament, that they might remember they had ſworn for the maintenance of the King and his poſterity.</p>
               <p>Collonel <hi>Lambert</hi> being found to lurk up and down about the City, notwithſtanding the Order of the Parliament, was (as a perſon too dangerous to be truſted to himſelf at ſuch a time as this) committed to the Tower.</p>
               <p>Orders were ſent down to <hi>Hull</hi> by Collonel <hi>Alured</hi> and Major <hi>Smith,</hi> that Collonel <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſhould immediately deliver up that Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into the hands of Collonel <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and to repair immediately to <hi>London;</hi> and he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his former Declaration, that he was reſolved to keep it till the <hi>coming of King Jeſus,</hi> preſently obeyed the Order, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Fairfax</hi> accordingly took poſſeſſion of the place.</p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Arthur Haſlerig</hi> and others were queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Parliament and Counſell of State; but nothing extraordinary being found againſt him, as to the deſigns were then on Foot, it was paſſed by. The Parliament made S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter Killigrew,</hi> Governour of <hi>Pendennis</hi>-Caſtle; and worthy M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Morris,</hi> Commander of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>-Fort and Iſland.</p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:170564:151"/>
               <p>There was about this time a conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ten of the Counſell of State, and ten head-Officers of the Army, the Generall being preſent, concerning the Government; but the conference being only for mutuall informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſatisfaction, it had no reſult.</p>
               <p>The Parliament ordered that the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booth</hi> and his Lady ſhould be taken off the File, and given to him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to have his Encomium put on in the room of it.</p>
               <p>And now they obliterated the Engagement which was made by the Rump in 1649, (to free them from puniſhment, for the impious murther of their Gracious Soveraign) out of the Journall, and voted it to be null and void.</p>
               <p>And now the time of their diſſolution being come, they put out the Act for ſummoning a new Parliament, in the Name of the Keepers of the Liberties of the Commonwealth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Qualifications which they put out, being only theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all perſons who have adviſed, aided, or any wayes aſſiſted or abetted the rebellion in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All thoſe who profeſs the Popiſh Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All that adviſed or voluntarily aided in the Warre againſt the Parliament in</hi> 1641, <hi>unleſs
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:170564:152"/>they have ſince given a manifeſtation of their good affection, ſhall be uncapable of being elected Members for the enſuing Parliament; and no perſon elected and thus qualified, to ſit in the Houſe upon a high penalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though theſe Qualifications did ſeem at firſt to exclude a great number, yet divers eminent and worthy perſons, though they had actually been in the Kings ſervice in the late War, having been engaged in S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>George Booths</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell for the naturall intereſt, were elected and admitted to ſit in the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The City having compleated their Militia, as well Auxiliaries as trained Bands, made choice of his Excellency the Lord Generall, to be Major Generall of all their Forces; Major Generall <hi>Brown</hi> being Collonel of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe.</p>
               <p>The Parliament ordered 9000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> to be given to Major Generall <hi>Brown,</hi> in ſatisfaction for thoſe great loſſes which he had received under the tyranny of the Rump, for his noble and publick ſpirit. They likewiſe gave 20000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>, as a gift to his Excellency.</p>
               <p>And before their diſſolution they releaſed D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wren,</hi> who for about eighteen years had ſuffered impriſonment in the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> a man who doubtleſs deſerved better uſage, but that the times then did not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:170564:152"/>him. They gave power alſo to the Counſel of State to releaſe what Priſoners up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on State-matters, they ſhould ſee good, and particularly Maj. Gen. <hi>Lambert.</hi> They ordered a ſtop ſhould be put to the ſale of the Eſtate of the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> and Lord <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John,</hi> the firſt of which had his Eſtate taken away from him by more than helliſh injuſtice.</p>
               <p>Some neglect being in the Printer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Printing of the Act for the <hi>Militia,</hi> and it being ſuppoſed, there was a deſigne of ſome of the late Rump, to make ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Act, as might ſuit for their turn, or elſe upon the Parliaments diſſolution, by violence to hinder it: The Parliament order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Committee to take care that it ſhould be finiſhed with all expedition, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was performed. And ſo this part of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which was choſen in 1640. was now finally diſſolved in 1660. by their own Act, which was, <hi>That the day for diſſolution of this Parliament be from the ſixteenth of March</hi> 1660. Multiplicity of buſineſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſed them to alter the firſt appointed day.</p>
               <p>About this time our gracious Sovereigne King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, hearing of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions of affairs in <hi>England,</hi> and ſeeing how the face of all things began to alter, ſo that
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:170564:153"/>great probability there was of being admitted to his undoubted Right, without the effuſion of his Subjects blood, removed his Court from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> a Town belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Siſter the Princeſs of <hi>Orange;</hi> there expecting till <hi>England</hi> might be brought into ſuch a poſture, as might fit it for his happy and wiſhed for reception.</p>
               <p>The Parliament at their diſſolution had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on the Counſel of State all Power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in the Interval, till the aſſembling of the Free Parliament, <hi>April</hi> 25. 1660. which accordingly they executed ſo prudently and wiſely, and preſerved the Nation in peace, and put the affairs of the Kingdom in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as did give the enſuing Parliament, liberty to do what they pleaſed, or found convenient for the right ſettlement of the Government.</p>
               <p>The Counſel of State had nothing more to take care of then the <hi>Militia,</hi> which bleſſed be God was through the care of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the reſpective Counties, and their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the ſame put into the hands of ſuch conſiderable perſons of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> as were not like upon any occaſions to proſtitute their faith and Country, upon the baſe Mechanicall ends of ſelf-profit or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. And good reaſon was there for its ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and good ſetlement, the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:170564:153"/>diſcontented <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the late diſcarded Rump, did all they might underhand, to bring the Counſel of State and their proceedings into odium with the people, and to ſtir up their own followers, with the Souldiery to mutinie againſt their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and the preſent power; and to this purpoſe they put out ſeverall moſt ſcurrilous, and abuſive Libels in defamation of the <hi>Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty;</hi> repreſenting him to the guilty conſciences, of thoſe whoſe crimes had juſtly made them fearfull, <hi>To be of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the moſt cruel and arbitrary, and that notwithſtanding the thoughts of the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who ſo vigorouſly now promoted his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; he would ſhew them as little mercy, as to thoſe they called Fanaticks; nor would they find any diſtinction from him when once reſetled.</hi> Theſe and the like moſt opprobrious calumnies were divulged concerning him, in generall Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, but eſpecially in one, entituled <hi>a letter from Bruſſels,</hi> ſuppoſed to be writ by <hi>Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Needham,</hi> (a fellow who moſt highly deſerves the prefixion of the black <hi>Theta</hi>) <hi>or the Rumps man Thomas,</hi> but printed by <hi>Live-well Chapman;</hi> who for his private profit had for a long time been the Devils inſtrument, in making publick divers erroneous and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opinions of the hotheaded Sectaries; and

But the prudent <hi>Counſel of State</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of it, immediately ſent order for his apprehending, which he underſtanding, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fled, but was followed by a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which for ſometime he avoided, by hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe; but at laſt being by Gods juſt judgement diſcovered, is now in priſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the due reward of ſuch nefarious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes.</p>
               <p>But they were not only blowing the bellows of ſedition, by their incendiary Libels, but alſo by the old trick of Agitators (which were two out of every Regiment choſen to debauch the Army) the indeavour to draw the Souldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from their due obedience, and ſeduce them to ſide with their corrupt intereſt; and very buſie were theſe inſtruments of ſedition, till by a wholeſome Order of the Counſel of State, which was a Proclamation, That whoſoever ſhould apprehend any of theſe Agitators, ſhould have 10<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> given him as a reward: there were divers of them ſeized on, and ſecured, and ſo their deſignes in a good manner rendred ineffectuall. Yet notwithſtanding all care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ſuppreſſing their indeavours, they had formed a deſign, which had not it met with moſt timely prevention, muſt have proved
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:170564:155"/>moſt dangerous to the Nations quiet, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved it in the confuſion of a ſecond War. For theſe infamous perſons who ſo lately lorded it over the Kingdome, not able to indure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be turned into their firſt Sphear, and fearing they ſhould ſhortly feel the weight of their crimes, to ſink them, under a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, had throughout the whole Nation ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up as many as poſſible they could engage, upon the firſt opportunity to make an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and ſo having prepared their deſign, in order to action, they find meanes for <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s eſcape out of the Tower of <hi>London</hi> (as may juſtly be ſuppoſed by the conveyance and conſent of ſome who had charge of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) that ſo they might not want a head, who would in ſome ſort be acceptable to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Counſel of State having notice of his eſcape, proclaimed him guilty of High-treaſon if he did not within 24. houres render himſelf to the next Garriſon; but he notwithſtanding this eſcaped, and after a while appeared hard by <hi>Edgehill,</hi> together with <hi>Creed</hi> and other of his aſſociates, in order to the framing of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for thither it was that all the Fanatiks, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with diſcontented Souldiers were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, and make their rendezvouſe; and there doubtleſſe had they been ſuffered to remain a while, they would have made a very formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:170564:156"/>party. But their appearance being heard of in the Country about, notice was given to vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Coll. <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi> Coll. <hi>Roſſiter</hi> and others, whoſe Forces quartered about them, and ſo all the paſſages thither being on every ſide ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, theſe Rebels removed their quarter, and marched towards <hi>Daintry,</hi> whither they were followed by Coll. <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> with a party of Horſe and Foot, and there diſperſed, without ſcarce a drop of blood; the Party betaking themſelves to their heels, and their grand Ringleader <hi>Lambet</hi> falling into the hands of ſtout and victorious <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi> was taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering ſo much as to draw a ſword in his own defence; and was preſently after ſent up to <hi>London,</hi> with <hi>Creed, Heſilrig</hi>'s ſon and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the Coach which brought them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Hide-Park corner, juſt when the whole Forces of the City were there Muſtring, to be in a readineſs to defend their Country, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch Traitors and Rebels as he had manifeſted himſelf. Being brought up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> he was with the reſt committed to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place of reſidence, and there remains till his due time.</p>
               <p>About this time a dangerous tumult had like to have happened at <hi>Glocester,</hi> about the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Major Generall <hi>Maſſey</hi> thither, to be elected for a Parliament man; which was
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:170564:156"/>briefly thus. He ariving there on Saturday night in cognito intended to lie private: but notice being brought to the Major, he came, and with an invitation, fetched him to his own houſe; and the next day took him with him to Church, but as he was going home from thence together with him, and the Miniſter who preached before them; the Captain of the <hi>Guard</hi> having notice, came and ſaid hold of the Major General, and told him he was his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner: and the rude Souldiery (the Miniſter ſteping up to ſpeak in his defence) drew, and threatned to take away his life: which being heard by ſome of the Townſmen, who feared ſome violence would hereupon be offered to the life of their beloved Governour, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately raiſed the whole Town in a commotion, and a party of Soldiers going to the Croſſe with reſolution to ſuppreſſe ſome which were there aſſembled, were ſet upon by the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and diſperſed, and their Commander with ſeverall of them knockt down and wounded; and the mutiny being thus heightned it is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought it muſt have ended in the ſlaughter of all the Souldiers in the Town, had not the mediation of the Major, and his paſſing his word that the Major Generall ſhould make his appearance before the Counſel of State at <hi>London,</hi> at laſt put an end to the fray and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:170564:157"/>And the Major Generall being that afternoon made a Free-man of the City, did a day or two after come up to <hi>London,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf to the Counſel according to their Order, whereupon he was diſmiſſed, and was by his <hi>Gloceſter</hi> friends choſen with free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for one of their Burgeſſes.</p>
               <p>Great were the expectations of this time, what the Counſel of State would do concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King, many being of opinion and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident, that they would bring him in before the beginning of the Parliament, all men antedating the time of his reſtoration by their longing and earneſt deſires of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day, wherein they might ſee him ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne of his Anceſtors, and the Nation reſtored to its true and ancient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
               <p>The deſignes of the Fanaticks did now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear almoſt in every County; but the head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brok in <hi>Lambert,</hi> the Members could not long enjoy life and motion; but in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they were diſperſed, and the chief Ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders taken, amongſt whom Major General <hi>Harriſon,</hi> who was taken in <hi>Staford</hi>-ſhire, was moſt conſiderable.</p>
               <p>But the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> being now come, a day of greateſt expectation by the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Parliament met in their Houſe, where
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:170564:157"/>the firſt day nothing of moment paſſed, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they choſe their Speakers, and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Harbotle Grimſtone</hi> for the Houſe of Commons, a man of eminent parts and deſerts.</p>
               <p>The next day the Houſe of Commons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeverall Committees to take care of ſuch things as were firſt to come under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and the firſt was concerning double e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, and till the buſineſs was determined, none but thoſe who were returned in both the indentures, were to ſit in the Houſe. A Bill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vagrants, wandring, idle and diſſolute perſons was read. And not long after, The Lords confirmed their old Speaker, the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both houſes likewiſe. Ordered Thurſday <hi>May</hi> 10. to be ſet apart for a day of publick thankſgiving to Almighty God for his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull goodneſſe in ſtirring up and aſſiſting of General <hi>Monck</hi> and other worthy perſons in being ſo grandly inſtrumentall to the reſtoring of happineſſe to their Country; and Ordered to be obſerved by this Houſe, and the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and late Lines of Communication; and that the Thurſday fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after, be likewiſe obſerved the whole Nation; and this their Reſolve being by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Herbert</hi> carried up to the Lords, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concurred with them therein, and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:170564:158"/>ſo paſſed the Orders.</p>
               <p>The Commons reſolved, that the thanks of their Houſe ſhould be given to Generall <hi>Monck,</hi> as an acknowledgement of his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and unparalleled ſervices for the good of theſe Nations, and likewiſe Ordered thanks to be returned to Coll. <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> for his late emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervices; both which were by the Speaker elegantly performed accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Houſes on Friday <hi>April</hi> 27. adjourned till the Tueſday following, appointing Munday to be obſerved as a day of Humiliation by both Houſes, whereon D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Reynold</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hardy</hi> preached before the Lords, and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Gauden,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Calamy</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Baxter</hi> before the Houſe of Commons.</p>
               <p>And now appeared that happy day, Tueſday <hi>May</hi> 1ſt which is not to be mentioned amongſt Engliſh men without praiſe to Almighty God for his infinite mercy; it being the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he pleaſed at length to bring us out of that maſſe of confuſion and miſery, into which his juſt hand had ſuffered us to plunge our ſelves, into our former bleſſed and happy eſtate. For the <hi>Parliament</hi> having received by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Greenvile, his Majeſties moſt Gracious Letters and Declarations,</hi> it was unanimouſly paſſed by both Houſes, That according to the ancient and fundamentall Laws of this Kingdome, the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:170564:158"/>Government is, and ought to be by <hi>King, Lords, and Commons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings Majeſty beſides his Letters to both Houſes and Declaration, had likewiſe ſent a Letter to General <hi>Monck</hi> with the Officers under his Command; together with one to General <hi>Mountague</hi> and the Commanders at Seas: The ſubſtance of all which was, <hi>His Majeſties free and Gracious pardon to all that ſhould within fourty daies lay hold on the ſame, with reſolution (as far as in him lies) to preſerve them free from injury in their lives and Eſtates, liberty for tender Conſciences, and ſuch as differ in matters of Religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they diſturb not the peace of the Nation, and that all things relating to Sales and Purchaſes, ſhall be determined in Parliament; And the full ſatisfaction of the Arrears of the Souldiery, and receiving them into his Majeſties pay.</hi> Upon the reading of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention Letters and Declaration in the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there was all reverence ſhown due to his <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>ſo Royall a conceſſion;</hi> and one thing is worth obſervation, that the firſt who celebrated his Majeſties grace and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary goodneſſe was <hi>Luke Robinſon,</hi> a man whoſe former actings had rendred him deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly odious, but now I hope he hath made a reall repentance.</p>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:170564:159"/>
               <p>Never was Vote received with more joy then this was, by the <hi>Citizens</hi> and all others who could hear of it, at night the Bels, Bonfires, and ſhouts of the people, did highly demonſtrate their extraordinary content and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>On the next day the Houſe of Commons agreed upon a Letter in anſwer to his Majeſty, and reſolved that the Superſcription ſhould be, <hi>To the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty.</hi> And General <hi>Monck</hi> acquainted the Houſe, with an Addreſſe made to him by the Officers of the Army, wherein they did with one heart teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their reſolutions to demonſtrate themſelves the <hi>beſt and moſt loyall of his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> Which Addreſſe was preſented to the Generall by Coll. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Lenthall</hi> and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by all the chief Officers then in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Houſe Reſolved, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Claerges</hi> have leave of the Houſe to go to the <hi>King</hi> with the <hi>Lord Generals</hi> anſwer to his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him. They likewiſe Reſolved, that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Greenvile</hi> ſhould have the thanks of the Houſe and, receive 500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> to buy him a jewel as a reſtimony of their reſpect to him. Honeſt Ald. <hi>Robinſon</hi> acquainted the Houſe, That the Lord Major, Aldermen and Commoncounſel had likewiſe received a Letter with the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from his Majeſty, to which they deſired liberty of the Parliament to return an anſwer,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:170564:159"/>which was by this Houſe accordingly granted.</p>
               <p>An Agreement was made between this Commonwealth and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exchange of all priſoners, which was ſigned by the Marqueſſe of <hi>Caracena</hi> on the <hi>behalf of his Catholick Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>Lord General Monck,</hi> in behalf of this <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> and the Orders taken according for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of ſuch <hi>Spaniards</hi> as were priſoners here, which agreement is hoped will not end there, but that there will ſhortly be a finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all differences between both Nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 3. <hi>The Lords and Commons Ordered a Declaration for continuance of all Sheriffs, Juſtices of the Peace, Major, and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that were in office the</hi> 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>of</hi> April, 1660. <hi>and to exerciſe their functions in his Majeſties name and stile, and ſuppreſſe all unlawfull Aſſemblies, and puniſh all miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours againſt his Majeſties Royall Perſon and Authority, and to proceed againſt all ſuch Offenders according to Law and Juſtice, which Declaration was publiſhed Munday</hi> May 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Ireland</hi> arrived a Declaration of the General convention there, wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their deteſtation of the moſt execrable murder of our late moſt <hi>Gracious Soveraigne Charles the firſt,</hi> and the illegall proceedings of the High Court of Juſtice againſt him.</p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:170564:160"/>
               <p>The Parliament Ordered 50000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> to be ſent over to his Majeſty for a preſent, as a teſt of their duty and loyalty, and 50000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the payment of the Arrears of the Army, and ſent a Committee to the City to deſire them to raiſe the money immediately, for which they ſhould receive ſatisfaction by the next aſſeſſement, and receive in the mean the intereſt at 6. <hi>per cent.</hi> which was preſently granted by the City and care taking for its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proviſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Commoncounſell</hi> of the City of <hi>London</hi> to teſtifie their loyall gratitude to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> Ordered 10000<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> to be ſent for a preſent to his Majeſty, and 300<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> to be given to the Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>Upon the third of <hi>May</hi> the Lord <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> having received a Letter from his Majeſty, together with his Majeſties gracious meſſage to the Houſe of Commons; the Letter to his Excellency and Declaration; preſently called a Counſel of War, to whom he communicated the ſaid Letters, which were received by them all with much hearty affections and teſtimonies of their exact loyalty and duty to his Majeſty: whereupon the General firing the firſt Gun himſelf cried, God bleſſe <hi>King Charles;</hi> the Guns from the reſt of the Fleet, with thoſe from <hi>Deal</hi> and <hi>Sandwich</hi> Caſtles, did with loud Vollies re-eccho the joy for ſuch a happy time, the ſhouts of the Seamen teſtifying their extraordinary cheerfullneſſe and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity.</p>
               <p>But now comes the day, the like whereof was never enrolled in the Enguiſh Calender, nor ever was there known a day whereon the people did with ſo unanimous and generall conſent teſtifie their unexpreſſible content and gladneſs. And well might they, ſince from this time alone we can truly date the reſtored hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of the Engliſh Nation, what paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being as it were only glimmerings of this immenſe, and radiant light.
